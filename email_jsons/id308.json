Registration Information: (Deadline: June 30, 2013)\n   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp13/ws/registration\n\nD. Financial Assistantship for full-Time Students:\n\n   The congress has finalized the financial assistantship decisions for students\n   who are affiliated with non-USA institutions (decisions were communicated\n   with the awardees in March and April 2013). Unfortunately, a few of our awardees\n   are not able to secure USA visa in a timely manner to attend the meeting. The\n   congress is now providing the released funds to full-time graduate students who\n   are enrolled in USA institutions. This financial assistantship is for\n   attendance only (ie, excludes speakers and authors of papers). Sponsored\n   students will receive the complete conference package (printed books/proceedings,\n   DVD, dinner reception, 4 breakfasts, 12 refreshments, access to all tracks and\n   tutorials, ...), registration fee waiver, possibly with partial help with hotel\n   accommodation, and/or possibly some help with airfare. In order to apply, send\n   the following information for consideration to sc@world-comp.org as soon as\n   possible (include as attachments in pdf only): a 2-page CV; a letter from your\n   major professor or Department Head/Chair stating that you are a full-time\n   graduate student in good standing; and a break-down of your itemized costs\n   (airfare, hotel, ...). Please also provide any matching fund you may be able\n   to secure. In the Subject Header of your email write \"student sponsorship\".\n   Award decisions will be finalized within 48 hours of receipt of the requested\n   information.\n\nE. Congress Schedules/Programs: (under construction - will be made\n   available during the first week of July - either by email or on the web)\n   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp13/ws/program\n\nF.
