All accepted\npapers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN)\nand will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed\nin science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for\neach paper. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers\n(about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers\ninclude: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the\nopportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication\nin these books. The web sites for the two book series will be made\navailable after the logistics are finalized between our committee and the\npublishers (both book series projects have been approved.) We anticipate\nhaving between 10 to 20 books a year in each of these book series projects.\nEach book in each series will be subject to Elsevier and Springer science\nindexing products (which includes: Scopus, Ei village, SCI, ...).\n\nSERP'13 is composed of a number of tracks, including: tutorials, sessions,\nworkshops, posters, and panel discussions.

All reasonable\ntypesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted\npapers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to\nprepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been\npreviously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The\nfirst page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a\nmaximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content\nof the paper. The name of the conference (ie, SERP) must also be\nstated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word\nabstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)\nwill be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees.\nPapers whose authors include a member of the conference program\ncommittee will be evaluated using the double-blinded review process.\n(Essay/philosophical papers will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The\nInstitute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for\nScientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from\nINIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN\nInternational); and others. Though, there is no guarantee that the\nproceedings will also be included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings;\nin the past, the proceedings were included in these databases. Therefore,\nwe will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI\nCompendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for\ndistribution on site at the conference.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the\nopportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication\nin these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each\nof these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,\nEi village, SCI, ...).\n\nSUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:\n\nPoster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except\nfor the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author\nshould state that \"This paper is being submitted as a poster\". Poster\npapers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the\naccepted paper wishes to do so.\n\n\nMEMBERS OF PROGRAM AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEES:\n\nCurrently being finalized.

The\nCongress is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer\nscience, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to\nhave 2,100 or more attendees from over 85 countries.\n\nThe 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote\nlectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and\nposter presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers\nhave included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of\nCalifornia, Berkeley), Dr. K.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 2012, papers published in the Congress proceedings have\nreceived over 27,000 citations (includes about 2,000 self-citations).\nCitation data obtained from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
