Therefore, you are\nencouraged to also check the schedules of other joint conferences. In\nparticular, sessions in BIOCOMP'12, DMIN'12, EEE'12, GEM'12, IKE'12, and\nIPCV'12, discuss topics that are within the scope of ICAI; these have\nbeen scheduled so that selected ICAI'12 attendees can also participate in\nthem.\n\nNote that each conference is divided into a number of topical sessions. These\nsessions are not necessarily scheduled in the same room/location. Therefore,\nconference attendees are to check the location of the session(s) they wish to\nattend; The conference room numbers (Locations) appear in this document.\n\n=======================================================================\nJuly 15 July 15 July 15 July 15 July 15 July 15 July 15 July 15 July 15\n=======================================================================\n\n03:00 - 09:00pm: REGISTRATION (Second Floor, Conference Lobby; 1-5)\n\n\n=======================================================================\nJuly 16 July 16 July 16 July 16 July 16 July 16 July 16 July 16 July 16\n=======================================================================\n\n6:30am - 5:00pm:  REGISTRATION (Second Floor, Conference Lobby: 1-5)\n\n\n08:30 - 08:45am:  Congress Opening Remarks - July 16, Monday:\n                  Professor Hamid R.
