Papers must not have been\npreviously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author as well\nas a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content\nof the paper. The first page should also identify the name of the\nContact/Corresponding author together with his/her professional email\naddress. A 100 to 150-word abstract should appear on the first page.\nAuthors are to conform to the common CODE OF ETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The\ndocument for the Code of Ethics is available on the DMIN web site and\non http://world-comp.org/download/code-of-ethics.docx ).\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The printed proceedings/books will\nbe available for distribution on site at the conference. The proceedings\nwill be indexed in science citation databases that track citation\nfrequency/data. The proceedings/books of the federated congress that\nthis conference is part of have been evaluated for inclusion into major\nscience citation index databases. We are happy to report that so far,\nthe evaluation board of science citation index databases have approved\nthe indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the following conference\ntracks into relevant indexing databases (indexing databases include,\namong others: Scopus, Engineering Village, EMBASE, and others):\nBIOCOMP, DMIN, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA, and SAM. All\nproceedings are also approved for inclusion into EBSCO (www.ebsco.com),\none of the largest subject index systems. The titles of proceedings of the\nfederated congress have been indexed into the ACM Digital Library\n( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes bibliographic citations from major\npublishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books. We\nanticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these\nbook series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others). For a recent and\na very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that have\nbeen published based on the extended versions of our congress papers,\nsee the link below:\n\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals \n\nSome of these books and journal special issues have already received\nthe top 25% downloads in their respective fields - we already have a\nnumber of Elsevier and Springer books in the pipeline.\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:\n\nPoster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear in section SUBMISSION OF DRAFT PAPERS FOR\nEVALUATION - except that the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the\nfirst page, the author should state that \"This paper is being submitted\nas a poster\". Poster papers (if accepted) will be published as such, if\nand only if the author of the accepted poster wishes to do so.\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS/SESSIONS:\n\nThe conference is composed of a number of tracks. A track is a session,\na workshop, or a symposium. A session will have at least 6 papers; a\nworkshop at least 12 papers; and a symposium at least 18 papers. Track\nchairs will be responsible for all aspects of their tracks, including:\nsoliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ... The names of track chairs\nwill appear as Associate Editors in the conference proceedings and on\nthe cover of the printed books (and would be indexed in science databases\nas such). Track chairs who attract a sufficient number of solid papers\ncan propose to edit books with a major publisher based on the extended\nversions of the papers accepted in their tracks (the conference will\nfacilitate and help such track chairs to get the publisher's approval).\n\nProposals to organize tracks (sessions, workshops, or symposiums) should\ninclude the following information: name and address (+ email) of proposer,\nhis/her biography, title of track, a 100-word description of the topic of\nthe track (also mention the name of this conference), and a short\ndescription on how the track will be advertised (in most cases, track\nproposers solicit papers from colleagues and researchers whose work is\nknown to the track proposer). E-mail your track proposal to\nconference-chair@dmin-2015.com and cc to special-session-chair@dmin-2015.com . \nWe would like to receive the track proposals as soon as possible\n(preferably by February 15, 2015.)\n\n\nMEMBERS OF PROGRAM AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEES:\n\nCurrently being finalized.

To get a feeling about the conferences'\natmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:\n\nhttp://worldcomp.phanfare.com/\nhttp://worldcomp.phanfare.com/6626396 (to see a slide show, click on\n\"Start SlideShow\" tab at the url above.)\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\ni.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines. 138939\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 8, 2014, proceedings of the federated congress that this\nconference (DMIN) is part of, have received over 27,878 citations\n(includes 3,346 self-citations). Citation data is obtained from Microsoft\nAcademic Search. The citation data does not even include more than 15,000\nother citations to papers published by conferences whose first offerings\nwere initiated by the congress.
