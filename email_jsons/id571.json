We call this area 'player-computer interaction'. The goal of the CHI PLAY conference is to highlight and foster discussion on high-quality research in games and HCI as a foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference blends academic research papers, interactive play demos, and industry insights. Full paper acceptance rate is typically below 30%.\r\n\r\n*** SUBMISSIONS ***\r\n\r\nAs a SIGCHI-sponsored conference, CHI PLAY welcomes contributions that further an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, including, but not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n- Playful interactions and new game mechanics\r\n- Innovative implementation techniques that affect player experiences\r\n- Studies of applied games and player experiences (e.g., games and play for health,\r\nwellbeing, and learning)\r\n- Accessible and inclusive design and play experience\r\n- Advances in game user research and game evaluation methods\r\n- Psychology of players and typologies of games and players\r\n- Gamification, persuasive games, and motivational design\r\n- Virtual and augmented reality in games and play\r\n- Novel controls, input or display technologies for games and play\r\n- Tools for game creation\r\n- Innovations to advance the work of game designers and developers\r\n- Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences\r\n- Developer experiences and studies of developers\r\n- Industry case studies\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough CHI PLAY welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experience, technical contributions without clear indications of the impact on players or developers are not within the scope of CHI PLAY. The conference invites submissions including full papers, workshop and course proposals, interactive demos, work-in-progress papers, and Rapid Communications papers. Additionally, students are invited to submit to the student game competition and the doctoral consortium.\r\n\r\n*** RAPID COMMUNICATIONS PAPERS ***\r\n(formerly Spotlight Papers)\r\n\r\nUp to 10 pages, in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, references excluded\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00)):\r\nJuly 5, 2019:          Rapid Communications papers submission deadline\r\nAugust 2, 2019: Notification of acceptance\r\nAugust 16, 2019:    Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nBy bringing research and industry closer, the game research, design, and development community can benefit. 'Rapid Communications  is an innovative track at CHI PLAY focusing on specific topics of interest to the community, highlighting significant work from both industry and research. The track is particularly suitable for individuals, studios, and companies who want to showcase their work and share lessons learned from success and failure. We especially invite contributions from practitioners and researchers  within the game development, gamification, UX, game user research, and games education industries in the form of short papers and lightning talks intended to bridge the gaps between academic research and applied practice.\r\n\r\nThis year, the track particularly intends to shed some light on the black boxes of games industry and scholarship'.  We thus specifically solicit submissions exploring the following themes: Open questions in game development practice; cultures of information in games industry and academia;  and applied research within the games industry. Potential submissions could cover (but are not limited to the topics of) productive opportunities for research interventions and collaborations with industry, thoughts on how industry makes use of research inputs and generate research outputs, and the identification of research output in the games research field that had/has/will have a significant impact on the games industry.\r\n\r\nRapid Communications Papers are presented at the conference with a short lighting-style presentation format, with accompanying dedicated poster session immediately following. This gives authors the opportunity to present to the conference as a whole, then interface with attendees interested in the work. As with full papers, at least one author is required to attend the conference. Rapid Communications Papers are archived in the ACM Digital Library in the Extended Abstracts publication.\r\n\r\n*** WORKS-IN-PROGRESS ***\r\n\r\nUp to 6 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00))\r\nJuly 5, 2019:        Works-in-Progress papers submission deadline\r\nAugust 2, 2019:   Notification of acceptance\r\nAugust 16, 2019:   Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nWork-in-Progress contributions provide a unique opportunity for late-breaking results to be presented in a poster format. Papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted submissions are archived in the companion proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\n*** WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***\r\n\r\nUp to 4 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00)):\r\nMay 2, 2019: Workshops papers submission deadline\r\nJune 13, 2019: Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals\r\nJuly 5, 2019:    Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in bringing together a group of researchers who share your passion for the type of research you perform, consider the organization of a workshop. Workshops allow conference participants who share a common interest to deepen their knowledge and meet in an interactive, hands-on learning and discussion environment. They also provide good opportunities for community-building. Workshop proposals should focus on a theme in one of CHI PLAYs core areas mentioned above. We especially welcome workshops that bridge the gap between practitioner and researcher knowledge. Workshops should provide novel perspectives and generate ideas about player-computer interaction.\r\n\r\nIn prior conferences, such as CHI, workshops have resulted in special journal issues, books, and research projects. Others created communities and even evolved into their own conferences. We are happy to invite you to participate at CHI PLAY through the submission of a workshop.\r\n*** COURSES OR TUTORIALS ***\r\n\r\nUp to 4 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00))\r\nMay 2, 2019:         Course papers submission deadline\r\nJune 13, 2019:       Notification of acceptance\r\nJuly 5, 2019:   Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nCourses or tutorials at CHI PLAY should allow participants to learn new hands-on knowledge about player interaction with technology. They may relate to design, development and/or evaluation of player experiences.

We look forward to your submission at CHI PLAY, particularly if you are employing interesting techniques to create and evaluate playful technology, are working in game development or are designing with technology innovation in mind.\r\n\r\n*** CHI PLAY STUDENT GAME DESIGN COMPETITION  ***\r\n\r\nUp to 6 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00))\r\nJuly 5, 2019:        SGDC papers submission deadline\r\nAugust 2, 2019:   Notification of acceptance\r\nAugust 16, 2019:   Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nThe CHI PLAY Student Game Design Competition will provide a unique opportunity for students to showcase their interactive play systems and designs. The submission provides students with the opportunity to provide a description of their game. Students will need to submit a video of their game, as well as. proof of student status (full-time or part-time, all levels up to Ph.D.). A jury panel will nominate the best submissions for an interactive presentation at the conference, where a panel of experts choose the winners.\r\n\r\n*** INTERACTIVITY ***\r\n\r\nUp to 6 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00))\r\nJuly 5, 2019:        Interactivity papers submission deadline\r\nAugust 2, 2019:   Notification of acceptance\r\nAugust 16, 2019:   Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nThe Interactivity track is an opportunity for researchers, designers and artists within the wider CHI PLAY community to showcase their work in a hands-on setting that gives conference attendees the opportunity to explore and discuss their systems. We are looking for submissions that push the boundaries of playful human-computer interaction through technical advancement, innovative interaction concepts, or stimulate artistic and critical reflection through design. Each submission to this track consists of a live artefact to be demonstrated at the conference along with an extended abstract submission that describes the system.\r\n\r\nThis year, the Interactivity track at CHI PLAY invites submissions in two main categories, research and design. Submissions to the research category are expected to make a contribution to our understanding of how humans interact with playful technologies, which needs to be evidenced by thoroughly situating results in previous research in our field when preparing the extended abstract. Submissions to the design category are expected to provide an experience that engages conference attendees and stimulates conversation; in their abstract submission we expect authors to describe and reflect on the expected experience.\r\n\r\n*** DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM ***\r\n\r\nUp to 4 pages in SIGCHI Extended Abstract format, excluding references, plus a three to four-page Appendix\r\n\r\nImportant dates (all times are 23:59 Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (UTC -10:00))\r\nJuly 5, 2019:        Doctoral Consortium papers submission deadline\r\nAugust 2, 2019:   Notification of acceptance\r\nAugust 16, 2019:   Final camera-ready papers due\r\n\r\nThe CHI PLAY 2019 Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in games and HCI in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of distinguished researchers. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work, to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with other doctoral students as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who are at least in their second year, have a clear topic and research approach, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. In addition to stating how you will benefit from participation, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium. Papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. In addition to their consortium contribution, accepted students will also submit and present a poster at the CHI PLAY conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\n* CHI PLAY 2019\r\n* 6th ACM SIGCHI Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play\r\n* http://chiplay.org\r\n* Twitter: #chiplay19\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\n\r\n--\r\nGamesnetwork, discussion list of Digital Games Research Association, www.digra.org\r\nNote: to unsubscribe, send \"UNSUBSCRIBE GAMESNETWORK\" to LISTSERV@UTA.FI from\r\nyour subscribed email account.
