    "body": "Dear all,\n\nThe decision to hold the PoCG conference in St Petersburg this year was\nmade by the PoCG steering committee. The intention was to reach out to the\ngroup of game scholars working at St Petersburg State University who have\nmade a notable contribution to the community, particularly at the PoCG 2018\nconference, and to accept their bid as hosts. I was not involved in this\ndecision but I have confidence that the committee thought about the issues\ncurrently being discussed. I believe that where the conference series has\npreviously been held was taken into account; St Petersburg will mark the\nfarthest afield from Western Europe that the series has gone, with perhaps\nthe exception of Istanbul in 2014. That is to say, there was the intention\nto be less Western-centric and to be inclusive of scholars who might\notherwise not have been able to participate, building bridges between\nacademic communities. As has already been mentioned, some of those who\nmight be excluded by the decision to only hold academic conferences in\ndemocratic countries include LGBT+ scholars from non-democratic countries.\n\nThere obviously has to be a balancing exercise as to who is included and\nwho else are then excluded by this very act of inclusion. Further, who is\nmaking the decision and how they are doing so must also be scrutinised. I\nbelieve that we are interrogating this now on Gamesnetwork. As a result, it\nis appropriate for the steering committee to review the situation and to\nconsider what can be done to foster inclusivity. They will report back\nsoon. I will also consult again with the organising committee.\n\nThis conference will not be deemed by the Russian government to be\nLGBT-themed. We very much welcome any LGBT+ content that is germane to the\nconference theme of the aesthetics of computer games and I do not believe\nthat the inclusion of such content will lead to attention from government\nforces, particularly because there will not be anyone present under the age\nof 18 and also because it is a small-scale English-speaking conference. We\nare now, however, considering having all the workshops and panels be on the\ntheme of diversity in games, with the papers still being on the\naesthetics of computer games. More details on this will follow.\n\nIt goes without saying that no city is safe. London, where I live, is\ndeemed a 'safe' city, but has recently seen homophobic hate crimes rise.\nhttps://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/hate-crime-dashboard/\n\nA particularly nasty attack on a bus against two women was just reported\nlast week. Of course London does not lie in an authoritarian state.\nTraveling to another city in another country involves a calculated risk for\nthose of us who are LGBT+. It is a highly personal decision to be made\nafter some thought and on the basis of the available information. Here, it\nmay be appropriate to distinguish between safety in Russia taken as a whole\n(listed as a lowly 157 in the 2018 Spartacus Guide), and safety in St\nPetersburg, perhaps its most LGBT-friendly city. On the one hand, it may\nhave been paternalistic for us to point to particular scattered sources\nthat one should consult when making this personal decision, but on the\nother, we could perhaps have done more to provide guidance. How to provide\nthis guidance - over and above having encouraged individuals to contact us\n- will be considered by the steering committee.\n\nThe technical feasibility of teleconferencing has not been settled and is\nstill on the discussion agenda. Obviously, it is no substitute to actually\nattending a conference and as such remains exclusionary, but it could be a\nuseful tool in a difficult situation that does not admit of easy solutions.\n\nFinally, to address a particular point that have been raised:\n\nI'm afraid I do not know about the specifics of laws aimed at known\nactivists. I will find out and let you know, Phoenix. This information will\nthen be on the website.\n\nIf my previous email was rushed and did not attend to the complexities of\nthe matter, I apologise. It has still not been possible to contact all the\nmembers of the steering committee and I represent here, as program chair,\nonly my own thoughts. Again, anyone who wants to get in touch with us\noutside of the listserv is most welcome to do so.\n\nThe steering committee will report back soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nFeng\n\n\n\nTeaching Fellow in Digital Media and Culture\nDepartment of Digital Humanities\nKing's College London\nRoom C0.07, Chesham Building\nLondon, WC2R 2LS\n\n\nOn Sat, Jun 8, 2019 at 1:02 AM   <1993p11@rambler.ru> wrote:\n\n> Dear all,\n>\n> First, I must agree with most points made throughout this thread.

Just to recap:</p><p>While promoting venues for international academic events, we must be upfront about any possible challenges and troubles posed by the local antidemocratic regimes or hate-groups or any other dark forces. We, indeed, shouldnt give anybody false sense of security. Russia is, indeed, NOT safe for LGBT&#43; people. Therefore, visiting Russia requires a careful consideration.<br><br></p><p>Such consideration, however, must be based on a systemic approach and has to take into account as much data as possible so an informed decision can be made. Statistics regarding street attacks and censorship in media surely tell us how homophobic Russian society and Russian government are, but they are of little help if our question is how likely it is that an LGBT&#43; participant of an academic conference gets into trouble. In that case we must consider the data regarding the number of academic conferences attacked by the government or whoever else on the basis of anti-LGBT ideology. Now there is a very straightforward bifurcation: an event (academic or not) is either explicitly LGBT-themed or it is not. If it is, then problems might arise, because our governmental or pro-governmental forces sometimes attack such events. But if it is not, then it goes completely under the radar. Russian authorities dont care about academic life. Needless to say, they dont have anybody in charge of inspecting each and every academic conference for ideological impurity. And it is exactly our case: this particular double-conference isnt LGBT-themed. Moreover, its topic is nominally way outside of what our authorities consider to be politics. For our authorities, it is just another academic event in a long chain of academic events which happen in our country all the time. There is no reason for them to pay any attention to this particular conference. We must take into account that Russia hosts many academic conferences in almost all academic fields each year (and we already hosted 2 international game studies conferences in particular). Now we must ask whether any non-LGBT-themed academic conference was ever attacked in Russia on the basis of having LGBT people or LGBT-themed presentations in them. Neither my colleagues, nor I can remember any such case, quick search also yields no results. To conclude: although nobody in a right mind will tell you that an LGBT person has nothing to be afraid of in Russia, there is also no reason to think that any reactionary forces will decide to target this particular academic conference on any basis, especially given that this conference is in English.<br><br></p><p>Next, Id like to address a broader matter regarding organizing conferences in anti-democratic countries in general. I believe there are LGBT&#43; scholars in all academic fields and I know that many academic fields within social sciences and humanities have LGBT-related topics. If the democratic countries decide to withdraw all international conferences from anti-democratic countries for security reasons (until everyone becomes democratic), then Im afraid this enterprise is doomed. Again, if asked about whether or not we should have a Queer Game Studies conference in modern-day Russia I would do my best to discourage everyone from doing so. But if we stop having game studies conferences or any kind of academic conferences in general in Russia and similarly repressive countries we will just further ghettoize their academic communities.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in case, Im not here to tell anybody &quot;how to academy&quot;; my point is, the longer this thread goes the more it sounds as if there were no academic conferences in Russia in any field EVER and now we are about to have the very first one in history and we have no idea how it may turn out. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">It is clearly not the case.</span> We started from whether or not it is safe for LGBT&#43; people to attend this very particular game studies conference, but after several posts I can see carpet-bombing statements regarding whether or not we should organize academic events AS SUCH in countries like Russia  or at least it sounds that way because it is not specified anymore whether it is about LGBT-themed conference or a conference in general, whether it is a game studies conference or a conference in general. And Id also like to make a remark about making a statement by excluding oppressive countries from potential conference hosts: the only people how will hear such a statement are scholars who already support LGBT, because oppressors themselves neither listen nor care.<br><br>This is a rushed response so it might appear unbalanced, I apologize for that and hope that it doesn't seem disrespectful towards anyone's position.</p></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>-----<br>Best regards,<br>Maksim Podvalnyi</div><div><br></div><blockquote><div>07.06.2019, 22:46, Alesja Serada &lt;<a href=\"mailto:alesja.serada@GMAIL.COM\" target=\"_blank\">alesja.serada@GMAIL.COM</a>&gt;</div><div class=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025messageBodyContainer\" id=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025part0\"><div class=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025messageBodyContainer gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025isInnerPart\" id=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025part2\"><div class=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025messageBody gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025isFormattedText\"><div class=\"gmail-m_-7266722231975712038gmail-m_1454415825238840025RMCYTJYM\"><div dir=\"ltr\">The EU already tried it with Belarus.
