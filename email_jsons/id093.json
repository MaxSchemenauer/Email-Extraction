Typically, data is collected from\n     devices and assets that is analyzed to monitor and manage\n     transportation systems, power grids, water supply networks, waste\n     management, law enforcement, information systems, schools,\n     libraries, hospitals, and other services. An important component\n     of a smart city infrastructure is smart mobility. Smart Mobility\n     focuses mainly on challenges that relate to transportation. Some\n     consider a successful Smart Mobility framework to offer modes of\n     transportation alongside or even instead of personal gas-powered\n     vehicles. Considering the above broad description, the topical\n     scope of CSCI-ISSC is given below. The list of topics is by no\n     means meant to be exhaustive.\n\n        Smart Cities:\n        - Algorithms\n        - City Infrastructures\n        - Communication Frameworks\n        - Big Data Analytics\n        - Health care\n        - Security\n        - Internet of Things\n        - Smart Grid\n        - Inclusive and Sharing Cities\n        - Sustainable Buildings\n        - Efficient Energy utilization\n        - Video Monitoring Systems\n        - Automation, Robotics, and Control\n        - Applications\n\n        Smart Mobility:\n        - Methodologies that help keep cities moving\n        - Traffic Management and Engineering\n        - Smart Public Transportation\n        - Self-Driving Vehicles\n        - Communication Logistics\n        - Parking Management Systems\n        - Cyber-Physical systems and Devices\n        - Economy of Smart Mobility\n        - Governance of Smart Mobility\n        - Cloud Computing Utilization\n        - Coordination Strategies\n\n\nPUBLISHER:\n     IEEE CPS: https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps \n     All accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the\n     2019 International Conference on Computational Science &\n     Computational Intelligence. Since its inception, all CSCI\n     proceedings have always been approved and included into IEEE\n     Xplore indexation, digital-library citation index databases.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:\n\n   https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/paper_submission \n\nTYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:\n\n  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):\n    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research\n    contributions. They must report new research results that\n    represent a contribution to the field; sufficient details and\n    support for the results and conclusions should also be provided.\n    The work presented in regular papers are expected to be at a\n    stage of maturity that with some additional work can be published\n    as journal papers.\n\n  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):\n    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should\n    provide overall research methodologies with some results. The\n    work presented in short papers are expected to be at a stage of\n    maturity that with some additional work can be published as\n    regular papers.\n\n  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):\n    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still\n    in their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend\n    to provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.\n\n\nDEADLINES - DATES:\n\n   October 21, 2019:     EXTENDED deadline for Submission of Papers\n                         https://american-cse.org/ \n   October 28, 2019:     Notification of acceptance (+/- 2 days)\n   November 8, 2019:     Final papers & Author Registrations\n\n   December 5-7, 2019:   International Symposium on Internet of Things\n                         & Internet of Everything (CSCI-ISOT):\n            https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/Symposiums/csci_is \n                         AND\n                         International Symposium on Smart Cities &\n                         Smart Mobility (CSCI-ISSC):\n            https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/Symposiums/csci_issc \n                         together with all other affiliated research\n                         events; for more information, see\n                         https://americancse.org/events/csci2019 \n\n\nDEMOGRAPHY HISTORY (based on 2014 through 2019 participation data):\n\n   In the past, about 42% of the attendees have been from outside\n   USA; from 59 nations. 56% of registrants have been from academia,\n   32% from industry; 11% from government agencies and research labs;\n   and 1% unknown.
