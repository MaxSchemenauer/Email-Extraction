Computer games can be regarded as playful media that organise our perceptions and modify our sensibilities. For this conference, we welcome submissions on (but not limited to) the following themes and questions: <br> \n<br>\n<b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a\u00edsth\u0113sis).</b> Is there an aesthetics or mode of experience that is specific to computer games? How do their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce distinctive experiences? How are \u2018experience\u2019 and \u2018perception\u2019 explored in computer games and shaped by them? Can concepts such as \u2018affect\u2019, \u2018atmosphere\u2019, and \u2018rhythm\u2019 be productively applied to computer games? What is the role of game interfaces on player experience? <br> \n<br>\n<b>2. Games as art?</b> What are the conditions of possibility of games being art? How do computer games fit into established categories or conventions of aesthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as having a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do accounts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against anti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games? <br> \n<br>\n<b>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b> Are games collaboratively authored? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring about different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do different bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies? <br>\n \nDo some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aesthetic orientation? Are computer games performances? <br>\n<br>\n<b>4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics.</b> What is the transformative potential of computer games and how does this compare to the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do aesthetic issues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones \u2013 what is the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sensibility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the social implications of this? <br>\n<br>\nIn addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open category, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this year\u2019s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the philosophy of computer games. <br>\n<br>\nSubmitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and philosophical (including media philosophical) issues in relation to computer games. They should also refer to specific games rather than invoke them in more general terms. <b>Submissions should be made in the form of extended abstracts of up to 1000 words (excluding bibliography).</b> Please indicate if you intend your paper to fit in the open category. <b>The deadline for submissions is 23:59 GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019.</b> Please submit your abstract through <b>review.gamephilosophy.org.</b> All submitted abstracts will be subject to a double-blind peer review process. <br>\n<br>\nNotification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late August 2019. A full paper draft must then be submitted by Monday, 14th October 2019 and will be made available on the conference website. <br>\n<br>\n<b>We also invite proposals for themed panels and workshops that will take place on the 20th and 24th October, 2019.</b> Please contact the program committee chair if you are interested in organising one. <br>\n<br>\n<b>We cannot provide grants or subsidies for participants. There will, however, be no conference fee.</b><br>\n<br>\nFor more information about the conference please visit <a href=\"http://gameconference.mediaphilosophy.ru/pcg2019.html\">http://gameconference.mediaphilosophy.ru/pcg2019.html</a> and <a href=\"http://gamephilosophy.org\">gamephilosophy.org</a>. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Visa information</b><br>\n<br>\nPlease note that you may need to obtain a visa to enter Russia. <br>\n<br>\nIf you need a visa you should apply for it at the Russian consulate in your country or at the visa service (the most popular is <a href=\"https://www.vfsglobal.com\">VisaGlobal</a>).

Our aim is to provide a meeting place for scholars of media philosophy and game philosophy in order to inspire future investigations into the commonalities and differences between these approaches.<br>\n \n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Conference Committee (full)</b><br>\n<br>\nProgram Committee: <br>\n<br>\nAlina Latypova (St Petersburg State University) <br>\nAnita Leirfall (University of Bergen) <br>\nDarshana Jayemanne (Abertay University) <br>\nFeng Zhu (King\u2019s College London)(chair) <br>\nGrant Tavinor (Lincoln University) <br>\nHans-Joachim Backe (IT University of Copenhagen) <br>\nJohn Richard Sageng (Game Philosophy Network) <br>\nKonstantin Ocheretyany (St Petersburg State University) <br>\nMarc Bonner (University of Cologne) <br>\nMargarita Skomorokh (St Petersburg State University) <br>\nMathias Fuchs (Leuphana University of L\u00fcneburg) <br>\nOlli Leino (City University of Hong Kong) <br>\nPawel Grabarczyk (IT University of Copenhagen) <br>\nSebastian M\u00f6ring (University of Potsdam) <br>\nSonia Fizek (Media Academy Stuttgart) <br>\nVeli-Matti Karhulahti (University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4/University of Turku) <br>\nWilliam Huber (Abertay University) <br>\n<br>\nOrganizing Committee: <br>\nAlexander Lenkevich (St Petersburg State University) <br>\nAlina Latypova (St Petersburg State University)(chair) <br>\nKonstantin Ocheretyany (St Petersburg State University)(chair) <br>\nMargarita Skomorokh (St Petersburg State University) <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFor additional queries, do not hesitate to email the organisers using the following email address: <b>feng (dot) zhu (at) kcl (dot) ac (dot) uk</b><br>\n<br>\nWarm regards, <br>\n<br>\nFeng Zhu<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTeaching Fellow in Digital Media and Culture<br>\nDepartment of Digital Humanities<br>\nKing's College London<br>\nRoom C0.07, Chesham Building <br>\nLondon, WC2R 2LS<br>\n--\nGamesnetwork, discussion list of Digital Games Research Association, <a href=\"http://www.digra.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.digra.org</a>\nNote: to unsubscribe, send &quot;UNSUBSCRIBE GAMESNETWORK&quot; to <a href=\"mailto:LISTSERV@UTA.FI\">LISTSERV@UTA.FI</a> from\nyour subscribed email account.
