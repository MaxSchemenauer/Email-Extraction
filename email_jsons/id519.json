    "body": "Hello All,\nIve followed this thread pretty closely as a trans game studies scholar, and what Ive read here isnt really reassuring. Given how LGBTQ folks often face harassment even in supposedly safe and accepting places, reassurances that it will *probably* be fine, and the government will *probably* look the other way for foreigners presenting on queer experiences and studies, and queer participants will be *relatively* safe ring pretty hollow. I was particularly alarmed when I read that LGB is probably fine, but the Ts might have to worry. I dont doubt that that is likely an accurate reflection of the situation given how trans, genderqueer, and nonbinary folks are most frequently targeted for harassment, assault, and legislation. However a situation where only some members of the LGBTQ community are welcome or safe isnt inclusive or helpful.\n\nThe teleconferencing option, while better than nothing, feels like a bandage on the larger issuepresenting from a distance often involves just giving the presentation and being involved with one panel and then leaving, which means missing out on a lot of the discussion and networking that makes conferencing valuable in the first place. It might be the best option available for providing safe presentation options to queer and particularly trans game studies scholars if the conference is to continue in St. Petersburg, but its not an ideal or particularly inclusive solution. I dont have an easy answer to this because there isnt one, but it seems to me that the conference has to decide between safety and support for LGBTQ game scholars and the importance of holding the conference in different locations that allow more people to participate. Whatever is decided here and moving forward, I think its important that the safety of queer folks not be sacrificed in the name of holding a conference in more locations, and ideally finding conference locations that accomplish both. I do hope that the St. Petersburg conference will provide opportunities to present for folks who arent able to make other international conferences and particularly local LGBTQ folks, though it seems that they too might have to be careful about what they present at the conference.\n\nI would also humbly submit that if youre working on a trans or queer game as a cisgendered and/or straight scholar and think that the queerness of that game is coincidental or not the main point, that you may need to think carefully about your positionality in relationship to that game, how you are using it, and to what ends. The minimization of queerness in games is a longstanding heteronormative project, and it would be disappointing to see game studies scholarship continue to contribute to it.\n\nBest Regards,\nCody Mejeur, PhD\nMichigan State University\n\n> On Jun 7, 2019, at 3:45 PM, Alesja Serada  wrote:\n> \n> The EU already tried it with Belarus.
