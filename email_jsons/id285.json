All reasonable typesetting formats\nare acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to\nfollow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author. The first page should also identify the name of\nthe Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best\nrepresent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the\npaper is being submitted for consideration must also be stated on the\nfirst page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length\nof the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7\n(two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online.

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 2012, papers published in the conference proceedings that\nare currently being held as part of WORLDCOMP, have received over 27,000\ncitations (includes about 2,000 self-citations).
