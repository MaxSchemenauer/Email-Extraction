They must report new research results that represent\n   a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for\n   the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work\n   presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of\n   maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal\n   papers.\n\n - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):\n   Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide\n   overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented\n   in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with\n   some additional work can be published as regular papers.\n\n - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):\n   Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in\n   their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to\n   provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.\n\nREVIEW PROCESS\n\n   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that\n   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel\n   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.\n   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,\n   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference\n   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members\n   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\n   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for publication\n   can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be evaluated by 4 members\n   of the Program Committee.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:\n\n   https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/paper_submission \n\n\nDEADLINES - DATES:\n\n   November 5, 2019:     Submission of Late Breaking Papers\n                         https://american-cse.org/ \n   November 7, 2019:     Notification of acceptance/rejection\n                         Two days after the date of submission but by\n                         no later than November 7, 2019\n   November 20, 2019:    Final papers & Author Registrations\n\n   December 5-7, 2019:   International Symposium on Internet of Things\n                         & Internet of Everything\n                         (CSCI-ISOT: December 5-7, 2019, USA)\n             https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/Symposiums/csci_is \n                         CSCI-ISOT will be held in conjunction with other\n                         affiliated research events; for more information,\n                         see https://americancse.org/events/csci2019 \n\n\nDEMOGRAPHY HISTORY (based on 2014 through 2019 participation data):\n\n   In the past, about 42% of the attendees have been from outside\n   USA; from 59 nations. 56% of registrants have been from academia,\n   32% from industry; 11% from government agencies and research labs;\n   and 1% unknown.
