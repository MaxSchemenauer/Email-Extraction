Indications\nare that we will have a superb gathering. We look forward to seeing you at the\nconference in July.\n\nKind regards,\nSteering Committee, ICAI 2012\nhttp://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws/conferences/icai12\nps.\n-> ICAI'12 paper acceptance rate has been 27% (as of May 4, 2012); this does\n   not yet reflect the data for all individual sessions (ie, the acceptance rate\n   is likely to change).\n-> See the appended text for useful information about the conference.\n-> If at least one author of an accepted paper registers for the conference\n   but for some reason he/she is unable to attend the conference, then\n   his/her paper will be published and arrangements would be made to ship\n   the proceedings to the registered author after the conference. However,\n   the registered author MUST inform us by no later than June 10 that he/she\n   will not be able to attend.\n----------------------------------cut here---------------------------------\n\nPUBLICATION:\n\nProceedings of ICAI will be published in printed (ISBN) conference\nbooks/proceedings and will also be made available online. The proceedings\nwill be indexed in science citation databases that track citation\nfrequency/data for each paper; such databases include: Inspec / IET /\nThe Institute for Engineering and Technology; The French National Center\nfor Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (covers the core\nscientific literature in Science; about 90% of inclusions are journals;\nonly about 9% are proceedings; this congress tracks are selected to be among\nthe 9% - accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit,\nQwam, and STN International); and others. Though, there is no guarantee that\nthe proceedings will also be included in EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings, in\nthe past various tracks of ICAI were included in these databases.\nTherefore, we will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures\nto EI Compendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available\nfor distribution on site at the conference. Like prior years, extended\nversions of selected papers will appear in journals and edited research\nbooks (a large number of book projects and journal special issues are in\nthe pipeline: Springer, Elsevier, BMC journals, ...) Authors of selected\npapers will be given the opportunity to submit the extended versions of\ntheir papers for consideration; this process will start soon after October\n2012.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nICAI conference is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a\nnumber of other federated research conferences. This federated congress\nis the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer\nengineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have about 2,000\nattendees from over 80 countries. The congress will be composed of research\npresentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel\ndiscussions, and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel\nspeakers have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U.\nof California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of\nNanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic Algorithms;\nU. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as Father of Grid Computing; U. of\nChicago & ANL), Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (pioneer, VR, U. of California, Berkeley),\nProf. Barry Vercoe (Founding member of MIT Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys\n(known as X-man, developer of X Window System, xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza\n(known as Father of Genetic Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey\n(NIH Program Director, U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U.\nof Southern California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and\nConsultant), Prof. Jun Liu (pioneer, Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard U.),\nProf. Lotfi A. Zadeh (Father of Fuzzy Logic), Dr. Firouz Naderi (Head, NASA\nMars Exploration Program/2000-2005 and Associate Director, Project Formulation\nand Strategy, Jet Propulsion Lab, CalTech/NASA; Director, NASA's JPL Solar\nSystem Exploration), Prof. David Lorge Parnas (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, RSC, CAE,\nGI; Dr.h.c.: ETH Zurich, Prof. Emeritus, McMaster U. and U. of Limerick),\nProf. Eugene H.

To get a\nfeeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2011 delegates photos\navailable at: http://worldcomp.phanfare.com/5408606\n\nAn important mission of the congress is \"Providing a unique platform for a\ndiverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers, developers,\neducators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted effort to reach out\nto participants affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities,\ninstitutions, corporations, government agencies, and research centers/labs)\nfrom all over the world. The congress also attempts to connect participants\nfrom institutions that have teaching as their main mission with those who are\naffiliated with institutions that have research as their main mission. The\ncongress uses a quota system to achieve its institution and geography diversity\nobjectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research\nconferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated research meeting held\nin a common place at a common time. This model facilitates communication among\nresearchers in different fields of computer science, computer engineering, and\napplied computing. The Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and\ninter-disciplinary research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased\nopportunities for cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF PROCEEDINGS:\n\nThe conference proceedings enjoy a high number of citations. As of\nMarch 2012, papers published in each track of the proceedings have\nreceived the following number of citations: 252 citations to BIOCOMP\npapers; 116 to CDES papers; 65 to CGVR papers; 55 to CSC papers; 271 to\nDMIN papers; 69 to EEE papers; 1,286 to ERSA papers; 504 to ESA papers;\n176 to FCS papers; 9,408 to FECS papers; 157 to GCA papers; 75 to GEM\npapers; 2,172 to ICAI papers; 1,529 to ICOMP papers; 1,247 to ICWN papers;\n571 to IKE papers; 255 to IPCV papers; 137 to MSV papers; 5,239 to PDPTA\npapers; 496 to SAM papers; 1,390 to SERP papers; and 177 to SWWS papers.\nIn total, over 25,600 citations have been made (so far) to papers\npublished in the proceedings of this federated joint conferences.
