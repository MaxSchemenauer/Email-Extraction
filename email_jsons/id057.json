All accepted\n   papers will be published by IEEE CPS in the proceedings of The\n   2019 International Conference on Computational Science and\n   Computational Intelligence (CSCI). Extended versions of selected\n   papers of the conference will also appear in journals and edited\n   research books (Springer, Elsevier, BMC, ...) The published\n   proceedings can be accessed via web portals, IEEE CPS, other\n   Digital libraries.\n\n   CSCI'19 International Conference is composed of a number of\n   symposiums, sessions, workshops, posters and panel discussions;\n   all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates:\n   December 5-7, 2019.\n\n\nSCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:\n\n   For a detailed topical scope for each research track, refer to\n   the web sites that appear at the begining of this announcement.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:\n\n   All accepted papers will be published by IEEE CPS:\n   https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps \n   in the proceedings of The 2019 International Conference on\n   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'19).\n\n   Papers should be typeset by using the general typesetting\n   instructions available at:\n   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html \n   (i.e., use of regular Times New Roman, font size of 10, single\n   line spacing, 2-column format). Authors of accepted papers\n   will later receive more specific typesetting instructions. All\n   submissions must be original (papers must not have been\n   previously published or currently being considered by others\n   for publication).\n\n   Submissions must be in either MS doc or pdf formats (6 pages\n   for Regular Research Papers; 4 pages for Short Papers; 2 pages\n   for Poster Papers - the number of pages include all figures,\n   tables, and references). The first page should include:\n\n   - Title of the paper.\n   - Name, affiliation, city, country, and email address of each\n     author (identify the name of the Contact Author).\n   - Abstract (about 100 words).\n   - A maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the\n     work described in the paper.\n   - Write the type of the submission as \"Full/Regular Research\n     Papers\", \"Short Papers\", or \"Poster Papers\".\n   - Write the acronym of the most relevant symposium that this\n     paper is being submitted to - the acronyms are:\n        Computational Science (CSCI-ISCS); Computational\n        Intelligence (CSCI-ISCI); Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, &\n        Cyber Security (CSCI-ISCW); Signal & Image Processing,\n        Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition (CSCI-ISPC); Smart\n        Cities and Smart Mobility (CSCI-ISSC); Education\n        (CSCI-ISED); Health Informatics and Medical Systems\n        (CSCI-ISHI); Mobile Computing, Wireless Networks, &\n        Security (CSCI-ISMC); Software Engineering (CSCI-ISSE);\n        Internet of Things & Internet of Everything (CSCI-ISOT);\n        Big Data and Data Science (CSCI-ISBD); Artificial\n        Intelligence (CSCI-ISAI); Social Network Analysis, Social\n        Media, & Mining (CSCI-ISNA); Cloud Computing and Data\n        Centers (CSCI-ISCC); Computational Biology (CSCI-ISCB);\n        and Parallel & Distributed Computing (CSCI-ISPD).\n        See https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/Symposiums \n        for more details.\n\n   The actual paper can start from the first page (space permitting).\n   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web\n   site portal at: https://american-cse.org/ \n\n\nTYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:\n\n  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):\n    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research\n    contributions. They must report new research results that\n    represent a contribution to the field; sufficient details and\n    support for the results and conclusions should also be provided.\n    The work presented in regular papers are expected to be at a\n    stage of maturity that with some additional work can be\n    published as journal papers.\n\n  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):\n    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should\n    provide overall research methodologies with some results. The\n    work presented in short papers are expected to be at a stage of\n    maturity that with some additional work can be published as\n    regular papers.\n\n  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):\n    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are\n    still in their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such\n    papers tend to provide research methodologies without yet\n    concrete results.\n\n\nREVIEW PROCESS\n\n   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for\n   papers that are philosophical in nature - such papers would be\n   considered for panel discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted\n   material will be maintained.  Papers will be evaluated on the\n   basis of originality, impact, significance, quality of research,\n   quality of writing, and contribution to conference program and\n   diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members of\n   the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\n   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for\n   publication can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be\n   evaluated by 4 members of the Program Committee.\n\n\nDEADLINES - DATES:\n\n   October 6, 2019:      Submission of Papers\n                         https://american-cse.org/ \n   October 18, 2019:     Notification of acceptance (+/- 2 days)\n   October 30, 2019:     Final papers & Author Registrations\n   December 5-7, 2019:   The 2019 International Conference on Computational\n                         Science and Computational Intelligence\n                         (CSCI'19: Las Vegas, USA)\n                         Including all affiliated symposiums:\n                         https://americancse.org/events/csci2019 \n\n\nDEMOGRAPHY HISTORY (based on 2014 through 2018 participation data):\n\n   In the past, about 42% of the attendees have been from outside\n   USA; from 59 nations. 56% of registrants have been from academia,\n   32% from industry; 11% from government agencies and research labs;\n   and 1% unknown.
