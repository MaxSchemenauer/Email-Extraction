Are you looking to receive guidance or feedback on your dissertation topic from the interactive storytelling community-at-large? Consider submitting to the ICIDS Doctoral Consortium!\n\nICIDS is the premier conference for researchers and practitioners concerned with studying digital interactive forms of narrative from a variety of perspectives, including theoretical, technological, and applied design lenses. The annual conference is an interdisciplinary gathering that combines technology-focused approaches with humanities-inspired theoretical inquiry, empirical research and artistic expression.\n\nThe Doctoral Consortium is an opportunity for PhD students in areas related with the topics of ICIDS to present their research work, at a stage where feedback from the community might be beneficial. Students will discuss the work with experts in the area and with peers in a friendly atmosphere where discussion and contributions will be encouraged. Students should have defined their research plan, and can be in intermediate or advanced stages of their research. Regardless of how far along the students are in their research, the work should still be in-progress and malleable enough to take advantage of the feedback from the Doctoral Consortium.\n\nThe deadline for DC submissions has been extended to August 16th. The ICIDS website https://icids.eae.utah.edu/ will reflect this change soon.\n\nSubmission\n\nDC Submissions can be completed through EasyChair at the following link:  easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icids2019\n\nLog in to EasyChair (or create an account if you havent yet), and then create a new submission under the Doctoral Consortium track. Youll then be prompted to upload the following the files:\n\n1.) A short paper (max 4 pages in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Format) describing the research work, results, status and next steps. The paper will be published in the proceedings. LNCS templates can be downloaded here under the section Templates, Sample Files, and Useful Links https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\n\n2.) A CV of the PhD candidate (1-2 pages)\n\n3.) A letter from the supervisor addressing the benefits of participating in the Doctoral Consortium at this stage of the research work (1 page). If supervisors prefer, these may be submitted independently from the rest of the submission. Please e-mail to bsamuel (at) cs.uno.edu, making sure to include the name of the student and ICIDS 2019 DC supervisor letter in the subject line.\n\n4.)
