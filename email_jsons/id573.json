The event will be hosted in\nthe new AU Game Lab and feature a reception afterward.\n\nThis is a deliberately intimate event.  Registration will be capped at 50\npeople, with priority to speakers to reward participation \u2013 so submit!\nCost will be minimal, primarily for food and facilities, and likely to be\nwell under $100, depending on the sponsorships we obtain. If your\norganization would like to be a sponsor, let us know.\n\n*WHO SHOULD SUBMIT:* Game and communication scholars \u2013 but also designers,\nDC game strategists and funders.\n\n*BACKGROUND:* This is a new twist on traditional academic conferences, with\nseveral unusual formats and some DC specialties including government\nfunding and policy implications for games research.  Today, the study of\ngames influences design, shapes our understanding of society, and is\napplied in domains from education to healthcare, museums and urban\nplanning. All are welcome. Emerging technologies, including Virtual Reality\nand Augmented Reality, use game engines even when applied to broader\ncommunicative purposes.\n\n*OUR GOAL:* We are deliberately hosting an \u201cAnte-Conference\u201d to allow for\nmore provocative content than that usually encountered in traditional\nacademic venues. Therefore, we not only request traditional research\npapers, but also solicit \u201cideas beyond research,\u201d including failures on\nwhich scholars can build, methods to link design principles to theories,\nand workshops to probe genuinely difficult topics of game research and\ndesign.  Traditional scholarship is still welcome, but the proposal should\naddress take into account the unique themes and goals of this conference.\n\n*DC NETWORKING IDEAS:* We also are looking for ideas on how the event might\nbest tap into Washington DC\u2019s rich universe of federal funding agencies,\npolicymakers and design practitioners.  Currently we are considering\ninviting select representatives to a networking reception at the end of the\nday, possibly with a keynote panel just beforehand. The focus will be on\nhow we should be improving the connection between research and\npolicy/funding/design.  Ideas in this direction can be submitted as an\nemail inquiry or as a more formal panel (see below).\n*SUBMISSION TYPES*\n\n*OPTION A:* more traditional, including:\n\n\u00b7        *Research Reports* and *Theoretical Papers *submitted as *Extended\nAbstracts *of *500 \u2013 1200 words*. Each proposal should contain a (1) brief\ndescription of the research gap and theoretical background, (2) research\nquestions, (3) methodological approach, (4) progress and anticipated\nimplications. Submissions are not required to provide full results in cases\nof ongoing data collection, but presenters are expected to present their\nfindings at the conference. Make sure to give a sense of your progress so\nfar, and why you are likely to have something provocative or useful by late\nspring. Traditional papers will be given less priority than those clearly\nstating why they should be discussed outside a traditional conference\n(e.g., thorny issues about how to frame a particular finding may be more\ninteresting than basic learning gains from a game).\n\n\u00b7        *Panel Proposals *are to be submitted as *Extended Abstracts *of *500\n\u2013 1200 words*. Each panel proposal should consist of (1) abstract of the\ncore ideas the panel desires to address, (2) a rationale for the panel, and\n(3) a brief overview of individual topics covered. Non-traditional panels,\nor those relevant to the topics below are encouraged to apply. Evidence of\nhigh-quality speaking/speakers is recommended.\n\n*OPTION B:* innovative and provocative formats, especially as alternatives\nto the traditional structures of academic conferences:\n\n\u00b7        *Hall of Meaningful Failure*: We invite studies from scholars that\nshould have worked \u2013 but didn\u2019t. This format is meant to encourage scholars\nto view their research as being iterative and building upon itself, like a\nwell-designed game. Or perhaps to warn of a pitfall that more game scholars\nshould be aware of and avoid at all costs. Send a *500 \u2013 1200 word *proposal\nof what you will discuss. Indicate if you would like \u201cno recordings\u201d and\nfor attendees to avoid public discussion to make for a safer space for\nhonest discussion.\n\n\u00b7        *Implications for Policy or Funding*: These *1000 \u2013 1200 *word\npapers translate a recent publication in games or related research into\nclear recommendations (bullet points) for what policy makers should do\ndifferently, based on the insights of the paper. The source paper should\nnot be your own, or your team\u2019s work. Be as specific as possible about the\nfunding agency or policy unit that should respond.\n\n\u00b7        *University Studios*: What have university-led studios with\nexternal clients or earned revenue models learned about making games, and\nhow can they improve? Grant-funded labs could also share findings, so long\nas they can address how to balance the relationship with the funder in the\nmaking and distribution process. Submit a *1000 \u2013 1200 *word paper, ideally\ncomparing your studio or lab with at least one other institution or model.\n\n\u00b7        *Methods that Break Play*: How is studying games different from\nother fields of communication? Send a *500 \u2013 1200 *word abstract. Do we\nneed to tweak any established methods in order to study games well?\n\n\u00b7        *Design Principles*: These *500 \u2013 1200 *word abstracts will\ndirectly address how game studies scholarship can affect design. Each\nprinciple or \u201cmini-theory\u201d for design should be posited and defended, such\nas \u201cfriends lists should be ranked by recency.\u201d Such principles are needed\nso that designers can act on research findings.\n\n\u00b7        *Playful Societies*: These *500 \u2013 1200 word *abstracts reflect on\nhow playful practices are migrating out of games. This might include\nactivities like cheating or the subversion of norms and rules, as well as\nhow playful attitudes persist after the game is over. Papers can also\nprovide recommendations and ideas of how to bridge from games into other\ndomains and activities.\n\n\u00b7        *Well-Played-with-a-Theory*: We invite *500 *\u2013 *750* word\nproposals that bring audiences through a bit of real game play, either\ncommercial or serious games, with a twist; the talks must highlight a key\ntheory that is becoming more prevalent in game studies. We also ask game\ndevelopers to submit under this heading utilizing gameplay from their own\ngames. Ideally you should be ready to bring whatever console or adapters\nnecessary to show live gameplay.\n\n\u00b7        *The Wrong Term*: What\u2019s a word that game scholars should cease\nusing, or be using differently? Submit *250 \u2013 500 *word abstracts for\npresentations that will comprise \u201cmicro-talks\u201d lasting no more than 10\nminutes, followed by plenty of debate.\n\n\u00b7        *Demo* *(showcase)*: *250-500* word abstract, including the\ncurrent status of the project and readiness of the demo. We plan to show\ndemos during the lunch hour or evening reception in a parallel format.\nPriority will be given to games that are used to test a research idea or\napply a research finding in a novel way that advances our understanding of\nthe connection between research and practice.\n*Hints, Selection Process and Curatorial Approach*\n\nTo maximize quality with such fluid and unusual categories, the chairs will\ncurate this event.  Our goal is to make the day provocative and satisfying\nas an experience, not necessarily to represent all categories equally or in\nproportion to the number of submissions.\n\nOur main advice is to craft proposals that you find personally interesting\nand think your peers would find provocative with implications for the field\nor future research.\n\nWe expect the tone of the conference to be reflective, with plenty of time\nfor questions and discussion. It will likely have one keynote speaker,\ninclude an arcade that will showcase demonstration games (see above), and a\nnetworking reception.\n*How to Submit*\n\n\u00b7        Please email all submissions and questions to Maxwell Foxman (\nmfoxman@uoregon.edu).\n\n\u00b7        In the *title *of your *email *include the submission type under\nwhich you are presenting. As an example: For someone submitting under the\n\u201cWell-Played Theory,\u201d the subject line should read: *WELL-PLAYED THEORY:\n[Title of Submission]*\n\n\u00b7        Submissions should include authors\u2019 names, institutions and\ntitles. Where appropriate, submissions will be anonymized by the organizers\n(i.e., you do not need to remove your name) and reviewed by a panel of\ninternational scholars.\n*Important Dates*\n\n\u00b7        Deadline for submissions: January 31, 2019 at 11:59pm EST.\n\n\u00b7        Notification of Acceptance: February 22, 2019. (Speakers are\nexpected to register within a week of their notification of acceptance so\nwe can finalize the public program.)\n\n\u00b7        Be notified!
