Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following\n      on the first page of your submission \"IPCV: LATE BREAKING PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"IPCV: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\n   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"IPCV: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper\ncategories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttp://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 4, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for originality,\nsignificance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of contradictory\nrecommendations, a member of the conference program committee would be\ncharged to make the final decision (accept/reject); often, this would involve\nseeking help from additional referees. Papers whose authors include a member\nof the conference program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\nreview process. (Papers deemed to be philosophical, essay type, or about\ncontroversial topics/applications will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and will\nalso be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science\ncitation databases that track citation frequency/data for each published\npaper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier indexing\nproducts (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,\nwww.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,\nwww.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for\nEngineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,\nCNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,\nEBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition\nof the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference\n(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed\nproceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference\nproceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of\nsections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nIPCV is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is\nbeing held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research\nconferences; namely, The 2014 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer\nEngineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is among the top five largest\nannual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and\napplied computing. We anticipate to have attendees from about 85\ncountries/territories.\n\nThe 2014 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote lectures,\ninvited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations.\nIn recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers have included:\nProf. David A.

To get a feeling about the\nconferences' atmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\nhttp://worldcomp.phanfare.com/\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\nie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines.\n\nTUTORIALS:\n\nAll tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials\nthat have been approved so far can be found at:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp14/ws/tutorials\nWe plan to offer more tutorials (in addition to what is already posted on\nthe web).
