    "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nThis year the IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) 2019 will take place at Queen Mary University of London, UK, in August!\r\n\r\nIEEE CoG is expanding the scope from IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG) in order to welcome papers on not only AI, but all aspects of games research. Its aim is to bring together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in the field of Games, to discuss recent advances and explore future directions. Games offer a fantastic domain for computational creativity, game design, technology, education, social sciences and, undoubtedly, artificial and computational intelligence. The annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) seeks to share insights and cutting-edge research related to game technologies and design, covering scientific, technical, and engineering aspects of games.\r\n\r\n\r\nIEEE CoG calls for auxiliary papers due May 14 (non extendable!). This includes short (up to 4 pages), vision (up to 8 pages), competition (up to 8 pages) and demo (up to 2 pages) papers. For details on the scope of these papers please check our CFP on the website: http://www.ieee-cog.org/cfp\r\n\r\nSubmissions for all auxiliary papers are now open on EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cog19\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\r\n\r\n - All the accepted auxiliary papers will be published in IEEExplore and will form part of the proceedings of (the first) IEEE CoG. They are papers in their own right, exactly like regular papers.\r\n\r\n - You can submit to all available tracks (http://www.ieee-cog.org/topics) and special sessions (http://www.ieee-cog.org/#sp_sessions).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have 4 keynotes already lined up (http://www.ieee-cog.org/keynotes/)!\r\n\r\n  *   Prof. David Silver (Google DeepMind)\r\n  *   Emily Short (Spirit AI)\r\n  *   Theresa Duringer (Temple Gates Games)\r\n  *   Katja Hofmann (Microsoft Research Cambridge)\r\n\r\nPlease consider submitting or participating in the conference.
