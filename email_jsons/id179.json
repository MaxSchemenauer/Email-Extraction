Submissions must\nbe uploaded by April 19, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or pdf\nformats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -\nsingle space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats\nare acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to\nfollow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author. The first page should also identify the name of\nthe Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best\nrepresent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the\npaper is being submitted for consideration (i.e., FECS) must also be\nstated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word\nabstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will\nbe limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe FECS'14 proceedings will be published in printed conference books\n(ISBN) and will also be made available online. The printed proceedings/\nbooks will be available for distribution on site at the conference. The\nproceedings will be indexed in science citation databases that track\ncitation frequency/data for each published paper. Science citation\ndatabases include: Inspec / IET / The Institute for Engineering &\nTechnology; The French National Center for Scientific Research, CNRS,\nINIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO,\nOVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International); and others. Though,\nthere is no guarantee that the proceedings will also be included in\nSCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings; in the past, many of the proceedings\nof the federated congress that FECS is part of were included in these\ndatabases. Therefore, we will also be sending the proceedings for\nindexing procedures to SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer publishers\n(Transactions of Computational Science and Computational Intelligence).\nAfter the conference (the whole process takes 12 months), a significant\nnumber of authors of accepted papers of FECS, will be given the\nopportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication\nconsideration in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books\na year in each of these book series projects. Each book in each series\nwill be subject to Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which\nincludes: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others).

Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except\nfor the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author\nshould state that \"This paper is being submitted as a poster\". Poster\npapers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the\naccepted paper wishes to do so.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nFECS is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is\nbeing held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research\nconferences; namely, The 2014 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer\nEngineering, and Applied Computing.

The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\nie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines. 138939\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 14, 2013, papers published in the conference proceedings\nthat have been held as part of the federated Congress, have received over\n27,500 citations (includes about 3,300 self-citations). Citation data\nobtained from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ . The citation data\ndoes not even include more than 15,000 other citations to papers in tracks\nwhose first offerings were initiated by this joint congress.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS:\nThe information that appears in this announcement is correct as of\nJanuary 29, 2014\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
