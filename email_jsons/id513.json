Aesthetics as aesthesis (asthsis).* Is there an aesthetics or\n>>> mode of experience that is specific to computer games? How do their visual,\n>>> audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce distinctive experiences?\n>>> How are experience and perception explored in computer games and shaped\n>>> by them? Can concepts such as affect, atmosphere, and rhythm be\n>>> productively applied to computer games? What is the role of game interfaces\n>>> on player experience?\n>>>\n>>> *2. Games as art?* What are the conditions of possibility of games\n>>> being art? How do computer games fit into established categories or\n>>> conventions of aesthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games\n>>> recognised as having a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream\n>>> games? How do accounts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions\n>>> match up against anti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status\n>>> of computer games?\n>>>\n>>> *3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.* Are games collaboratively\n>>> authored? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions,\n>>> bring about different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences?\n>>> How do different bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about\n>>> the way in which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?\n>>> Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an\n>>> aesthetic orientation? Are computer games performances?\n>>>\n>>> *4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics.*\n>>> What is the transformative potential of computer games and how does this\n>>> compare to the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do\n>>> aesthetic issues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones \n>>> what is the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste,\n>>> sensibility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the\n>>> social implications of this?\n>>>\n>>> In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open\n>>> category, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this\n>>> years theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the\n>>> philosophy of computer games.\n>>>\n>>> Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and\n>>> philosophical (including media philosophical) issues in relation to\n>>> computer games. They should also refer to specific games rather than invoke\n>>> them in more general terms. *Submissions should be made in the form of\n>>> extended abstracts of up to 1000 words (excluding bibliography).*\n>>> Please indicate if you intend your paper to fit in the open category. *The\n>>> deadline for submissions is 23:59 GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019.*\n>>> Please submit your abstract through *review.gamephilosophy.org\n>>> <http://review.gamephilosophy.org>.* All submitted abstracts will be\n>>> subject to a double-blind peer review process.\n>>>\n>>> Notification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late August\n>>> 2019.

And while it is\n            absolutely\n            disgusting, from the practical point of view this law poses\n            no problem for the\n            foreigners coming for an international conference. The only\n            way someone could\n            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of\n            18 present on the\n            conference, and then someone would file a complaint about\n            him hearing something\n            positive about LGBT. But since conference would be in\n            English, and most Russians,\n            especially those who support this law, do not know this\n            language, I believe\n            that it would be fine.</span></p>\n      </div>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"gmail_quote\">\n        <div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_attr\">, 7 . 2019 .  16:46,\n          Phoenix Perry &lt;<a href=\"mailto:contact@phoenixperry.com\" target=\"_blank\">contact@phoenixperry.com</a>&gt;:<br>\n        </div>\n        <blockquote class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex\">\n          <div lang=\"EN-US\">\n            <div class=\"gmail-m_1069381800485872290gmail-m_673496691078246811gmail-m_4357909884783894982WordSection1\">\n              <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hi folks, </p>\n              <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n              <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Does anyone know the actual law for\n                those of us who are activists online?

I have been discussing this issue\n                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My\n                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an\n                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely\n                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There\n                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal\n                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the\n                  governments lamentable position. Of course nobody can\n                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope\n                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an\n                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.\n                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this\n                  discussion: <a href=\"mailto:feng.zhu@kcl.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">feng.zhu@kcl.ac.uk</a></p>\n                <p>Kind regards,</p>\n                <p>Feng</p>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n              <div>\n                <div>\n                  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Thu, Jun 6, 2019 at 8:01 PM\n                    Alesja Serada &lt;<a href=\"mailto:alesja.serada@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">alesja.serada@gmail.com</a>&gt;\n                    wrote:</p>\n                </div>\n                <blockquote style=\"border-top:none;border-right:none;border-bottom:none;border-left:1pt solid rgb(204,204,204);padding:0in 0in 0in 6pt;margin-left:4.8pt;margin-right:0in\">\n                  <div>\n                    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">I travel to Russia on a regular\n                      basis, to this particular research center as well\n                      (and they are doing a great job!).
