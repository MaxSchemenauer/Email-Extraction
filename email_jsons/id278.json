The\nCongress is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer\nscience, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to\nhave 2,100 or more attendees from over 85 countries.\n\nThe 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote\nlectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and\nposter presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers\nhave included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of\nCalifornia, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of\nNanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic\nAlgorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as Father of Grid\nComputing; U. of Chicago & ANL), Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (pioneer, VR, U.\nof California, Berkeley), Prof. Barry Vercoe (Founding member of MIT\nMedia Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys (known as X-man, developer of X Window\nSystem, xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic\nProgramming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
