Zip-Scene Conference on Analogue and Digital Immersive Spaces*\n*Budapest, 10-12 November, 2019*\nMoholy-Nagy University of Art and Design\n*Application deadline: 17th of June*\n\nNew digital tools provide novel opportunities for interactive digital\nnarratives (IDN) in mixed reality environments, performance art and\nanalogue immersive spaces. But does this mean that we can tell existing\nstories in a better way in these environments? Or should we change our way\nof thinking about how we perceive our world in order to create more\ncomprehensive narrative experiences? In a recent keynote (ICIDS 2018\nconference) Janet H. Murray \u2013 author of the groundbreaking volume Hamlet on\nHolodeck \u2013 the Future of Narrative in Cyberspace (1997/2016), reminds us\nthat \u201ca kaleidoscopic habit of thinking\u201d can help us \u201cenvision a more\nintegrated transformational future\u201d and \u201copen up the possibility of\nexpanding our understanding of the world and our cognitive capacity\u201d\n(Murray, 2018:17). To better grasp the complexity of the world, it is\nimportant to enhance emerging artistic practices in order to create\nopportunities for critical reflection while acknowledging the changed\nrelationship between creators and audiences turned\nparticipants/prosumers/experiencers.\n\nThis conference aims to investigate whether XR/extended reality (VR/AR/MR)\nworks will acquire a status comparable to film, performing arts and video\ngames in the near future. On this basis, we are looking forward to papers\nthat address narrative experiences enabled by XR and especially VR\ntechnologies. Papers should address either one or several of the following\nquestions:\n\nWhat kind of narratives can be used to create possibility spaces in such\nimmersive productions?\nHow much engagement with and control over the narrative path is desirable\nfor the audience turned participants?\nWhat design strategies can guide these participatory experiences: for\nexample, live performers, orchestrators, and set designers using the\nsensorium of New Horror (see Ndalianis, 2012) or somaesthetic design\nconcepts (see H\u00f6\u00f6k, 2018) to create novel forms of immersion in these\nenvironments?\nWhat kind of design strategies can we use to provide a satisfying level of\nagency to participant audiences and provide opportunities for co-creation?\nWhat is the current status of interactive digital narrative experiences,\nhave they completed their evolution from being media of attraction (see\nRouse, 2016) or there is still a long way for them to go in order to find\nthe right direction?\nWhat can we learn from a comparison of site-specific live arts productions\nwith those of VR projects?\nHow can we explore free-form play and rule-based gaming as different types\nof performances within mixed-reality theatre and immersive theatre?\n\nIn addition, we want to challenge established storytelling strategies and\ninstead more thoroughly analyze ways of creating engaging experiences:\n\nWhat kind of principles of video game design do XR productions make use of\n(e.g. puzzle dependency charts and plot-shaped level design - see Short,\n2019)?\nWhat design strategies createed the experience of full immersivity and\npresence for their users-turned-participants (see 2018/4 issue of the\njournal of Performance Arts and Digital Media).\n\nFurther developing Murray\u2019s perspective on the \u2018kaleidoscopic habit\u2019, we\nexpect presentations that engage with the practice of transdisciplinary\ncreators to adapt video game mechanics, various sensorium settings and\ninteractive narrative design strategies in order to create fully immersive\nenvironments. Possible analyzes can be on topics such as overall aesthetics\nauthorial affordances, design principles and conventions (Koenitz et al,\n2018) as well as the audience\u2019s experience (especially engagement and\nempowering mechanisms) and, last but not least, as interactive narratives.\nSome possible perspectives include Murray\u2019s affordances and aesthetic\nqualities of the digital medium, Bogost\u2019s procedural rhetoric, Kwastek\u2019s\n\u201caesthetics of interactivity\u201d, somaesthetic design concepts (H\u00f6\u00f6k), guiding\nstrategies based on New Horror\u2019s sensorium (Ndalianis, 2012) the\ntrajectories offered by them (based on Benford-Giannachi\u2019s concept) and\ninteractive narrative systems (Koenitz, 2015).\n\n*Conference themes:*\nInteractive storytelling methods\nInteractive videos\nVideo games\nLocation-based technology (with augmented reality)\nVirtual reality experiences&movies\nAugmented reality in interactive storytelling\nGames-based performing arts practices using new technology tools\nInteractive Museum\nImmersive environments (media archeology and phenomenological approach)\nTransmedia storytelling\n\nProposals may be for a paper or a panel and should be related to at least\none of the conference themes. *Deadline for submitting the proposals is\nJune 17, 2019.
