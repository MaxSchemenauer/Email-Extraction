For example, 2013 Ingress generated a hype\n            that was surpassed by 2016 Pokmon GO with an even larger\n            player base. From a didactical perspective, location-based\n            AR games, which encompass Ingress and Pokmon GO, have a\n            number of characteristics that make their use as learning\n            tools very appealing: location-based AR games guide learners\n            to real objects on location and supplement these objects\n            with information to be learned. One of the principles\n            supported is the contiguity principle: learning effects are\n            reinforced by the temporal and/or spatial combination of\n            object and information. Further prin-ciples of multimedia\n            learning, such as signaling (i.e. the insertion of\n            additional clues) can also be implemented with the help of\n            location-based AR games. Loca-tion-based AR games are also\n            suitable as social interaction triggers for collabora-tive\n            learning settings, such as the joint development of learning\n            content in groups or for making decisions and achieving\n            goals as a team.\n\n\n\n\nIn this workshop we intend to focus on the\n            benefits of location-based AR games for purposes beyond\n            entertainment, especially for learning. We would like to\n            foster a discourse about the specific contexts in which\n            location-based AR games are most valuable learning tools,\n            based on the debate of mobile and con-text-based learning.\n            Further, we would like to outline design guidelines that\n            en-sure a balance between serious purpose and fun when\n            developing and using seri-ous location-based AR games. Fun\n            is to be seen as an essential part of achieving high user\n            engagement. At the same time, however, it must also be\n            ensured that the serious purpose can be adequately achieved.\n            These two poles of fun and serious purpose create a dynamic\n            field in which the design of serious location-based AR games\n            has to take place. Further, inclusive design plays a key\n            role in enabling users with disabilities to enjoy augmented\n            game experiences.\n\n\n\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited\n            to:\n\n\n Design frameworks for AR games\n\n\n Lessons learnt from creative AR\n            applications\n\n\n Reuse of entertainment AR games in serious\n            application contexts\n\n\n Characterization of serious application\n            contexts of AR games\n\n\n Design of accessible AR applications\n\n\n Guidelines for the design of didactic\n            scenarios using AR games\n\n\n Assessment of didactic scenarios using AR\n            games and integration into ex-isting learning curricula and\n            learning infrastructure\n\n\n Case studies of serious AR games\n\n\n Content provision for AR games\n\n\n Analyses of AR game mechanics and their\n            transfer to serious AR games\n\n\n Technical infrastructure for AR games\n\n\n Multiplayer scenarios and their game\n            mechanics\n\n\n Gamification of location-based Augmented\n            Reality Games\n\n\n Learning patterns in AR-driven social\n            contexts\n\n\n Ethical issues of AR games\n\n\n\n\nAll submitted papers will undergo a thorough\n            peer-review process by the workshop program committee.\n            Accepted papers will be published as part of the official\n            ICEC-JCSG 2019 conference proceedings by Springer in their\n            LNCS se-ries. At least one author of accepted submissions\n            has to register and present at the ICEC-JCSG 2019 workshop.\n\n\n\n\n2 Submission Information\n\n\nPapers must be submitted in the Springer LNCS\n            format\n(\nhttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\n).\n            All submissions must be written in English and be submitted\n            via EasyChair\n            (\nhttps://easychair.org/conferences/submission_new.cgi?a=22316072\n).\n            The length of submissions has to meet 4 pages exclusive\n            references.
