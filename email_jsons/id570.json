However, the application range of video games that the workshop invites to explore has to be intended in its broadest sense: both entertainment and applied finalities.\n\n-----------\nTOPICS\n-----------\nThe workshop aims at collecting contribution advancing the research applied to video games.\nThis edition will especially focus on the influence of visual interface design on the final quality of user experience.\nSuggested topics include (but are not limited to):\n- Adaptive and Context-Aware Interfaces\n- Agency of objects\n- Artificial Intelligence applications\n- Biometric measures for interaction\n- Critical or meaningful play experience\n- Distributed and Online systems\n- Full-body Interaction\n- Game Design & Level Design\n- Human Computer Interaction applied to visual interfaces Immersive VR systems\n- Information Visualization\n- Interaction Design Tools\n- Interfaces for Social Interaction and Cooperation Motion-based Interaction\n- Moral choices\n- Multimodal Interfaces\n- (Multi)Sensory Interfaces\n- Procedural rhetoric\n- Sensemaking\n- Storytelling\n- Usability and Accessibility\n- Visualization techniques\n- Virtual and Augmented Reality\n\n-------------------\nSUBMISSION\n-------------------\nAll paper submissions must be in English, and they must not exceed six (6) pages in length, including references.
