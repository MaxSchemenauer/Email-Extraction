Aesthetics as aesthesis (asthsis).* Is there an\n>                 aesthetics or mode of experience that is specific to\n>                 computer games? How do their visual, audio, and haptic\n>                 aspects come together to produce distinctive\n>                 experiences? How are experience and perception\n>                 explored in computer games and shaped by them? Can\n>                 concepts such as affect, atmosphere, and rhythm\n>                 be productively applied to computer games? What is the\n>                 role of game interfaces on player experience?\n>\n>                 *2. Games as art?* What are the conditions of\n>                 possibility of games being art? How do computer games\n>                 fit into established categories or conventions of\n>                 aesthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do\n>                 games recognised as having a claim to artistic status\n>                 differ from mainstream games? How do accounts of art\n>                 based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up\n>                 against anti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging\n>                 the status of computer games?\n>\n>                 *3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.* Are games\n>                 collaboratively authored? How do different kinds of\n>                 play, or player-game conjunctions, bring about\n>                 different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic\n>                 experiences? How do different bodies encounter\n>                 computer games and what can be said about the way in\n>                 which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?\n>                 Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player\n>                 practices have an aesthetic orientation? Are computer\n>                 games performances?\n>\n>                 *4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of\n>                 game aesthetics.* What is the transformative potential\n>                 of computer games and how does this compare to the\n>                 transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How\n>                 do aesthetic issues interconnect with ethical, social,\n>                 and political ones  what is the autonomy or\n>                 heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste,\n>                 sensibility, and habit acquired with respect to\n>                 gameplay and what are the social implications of this?\n>\n>                 In addition to this central theme, the conference also\n>                 features an open category, for which we invite welcome\n>                 contributions that do not fit this years theme, but\n>                 that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the\n>                 philosophy of computer games.\n>\n>                 Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on\n>                 philosophy and philosophical (including media\n>                 philosophical) issues in relation to computer games.\n>                 They should also refer to specific games rather than\n>                 invoke them in more general terms. *Submissions should\n>                 be made in the form of extended abstracts of up to\n>                 1000 words (excluding bibliography).* Please indicate\n>                 if you intend your paper to fit in the open category.\n>                 *The deadline for submissions is 23:59 GMT, Sunday,\n>                 11th August, 2019.* Please submit your abstract\n>                 through *review.gamephilosophy.org\n>                 .* All submitted\n>                 abstracts will be subject to a double-blind peer\n>                 review process.\n>\n>                 Notification of accepted submissions will be sent out\n>                 in late August 2019.

And while it is\n            absolutely\n            disgusting, from the practical point of view this law poses\n            no problem for the\n            foreigners coming for an international conference. The only\n            way someone could\n            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of\n            18 present on the\n            conference, and then someone would file a complaint about\n            him hearing something\n            positive about LGBT. But since conference would be in\n            English, and most Russians,\n            especially those who support this law, do not know this\n            language, I believe\n            that it would be fine.\n\n\n\n, 7 . 2019 .  16:46,\n          Phoenix Perry <contact@phoenixperry.com>:\n\n\n\n\nHi folks, \n\u00a0\nDoes anyone know the actual law for\n                those of us who are activists online?

I have been discussing this issue\n                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My\n                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an\n                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely\n                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There\n                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal\n                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the\n                  governments lamentable position. Of course nobody can\n                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope\n                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an\n                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.\n                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this\n                  discussion: feng.zhu@kcl.ac.uk\nKind regards,\nFeng\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 6, 2019 at 8:01 PM\n                    Alesja Serada <alesja.serada@gmail.com>\n                    wrote:\n\n\n\nI travel to Russia on a regular\n                      basis, to this particular research center as well\n                      (and they are doing a great job!).

Playing\n                            games yields particular kinds of playful\n                            experiences or perceptions through the\n                            senses, which can be studied with an\n                            aesthetic focus, emphasising asthsis over\n                            nosis. Computer games can be regarded as\n                            playful media that organise our perceptions\n                            and modify our sensibilities. For this\n                            conference, we welcome submissions on (but\n                            not limited to) the following themes and\n                            questions: \n\n1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (asthsis).\n                            Is there an aesthetics or mode of experience\n                            that is specific to computer games? How do\n                            their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come\n                            together to produce distinctive experiences?\n                            How are experience and perception\n                            explored in computer games and shaped by\n                            them? Can concepts such as affect,\n                            atmosphere, and rhythm be productively\n                            applied to computer games? What is the role\n                            of game interfaces on player experience? \n\n2. Games as art? What are the\n                            conditions of possibility of games being\n                            art? How do computer games fit into\n                            established categories or conventions of\n                            aesthetics, and how do they contribute to\n                            new ones? Do games recognised as having a\n                            claim to artistic status differ from\n                            mainstream games? How do accounts of art\n                            based on necessary and sufficient conditions\n                            match up against anti-essentialist accounts\n                            in terms of gauging the status of computer\n                            games? \n\n3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.\n                            Are games collaboratively authored? How do\n                            different kinds of play, or player-game\n                            conjunctions, bring about different kinds of\n                            gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences?\n                            How do different bodies encounter computer\n                            games and what can be said about the way in\n                            which gameplay experience is mediated by our\n                            bodies? \n                            Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic\n                            player practices have an aesthetic\n                            orientation? Are computer games\n                            performances? \n\n4. The ethical, political, and social\n                              dimensions of game aesthetics. What is\n                            the transformative potential of computer\n                            games and how does this compare to the\n                            transformative capabilities ascribed to\n                            artworks? How do aesthetic issues\n                            interconnect with ethical, social, and\n                            political ones  what is the autonomy or\n                            heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are\n                            taste, sensibility, and habit acquired with\n                            respect to gameplay and what are the social\n                            implications of this? \n\n                            In addition to this central theme, the\n                            conference also features an open category,\n                            for which we invite welcome contributions\n                            that do not fit this years theme, but that\n                            nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to\n                            the philosophy of computer games. \n\n                            Submitted proposals should have a clear\n                            focus on philosophy and philosophical\n                            (including media philosophical) issues in\n                            relation to computer games. They should also\n                            refer to specific games rather than invoke\n                            them in more general terms.
