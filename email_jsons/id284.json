All accepted\npapers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN)\nand will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed\nin science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for\neach paper. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers\n(about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers\ninclude: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others). See the following links\nfor a small subset of the publications based on this Congress:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmedgenomics/supplements/6/S1\nhttp://www.springer.com/life+sciences/bioinformatics/book/978-1-4419-7045-9\nhttp://www.springer.com/life+sciences/bioinformatics/book/978-1-4419-5912-6\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/S1/I1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5?issue=S3\nhttp://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC3287490/\nhttp://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC2709251/\nhttp://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC2999338/\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity\nto submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration\nin these books. The web sites for the two book series will be made available\nafter the logistics are finalized between our committee and the publishers\n(both book series projects have been approved.) We anticipate having between\n10 to 20 books a year in each of these book series projects. Each book in\neach series will be subject to Elsevier and Springer science indexing\nproducts (which includes: Scopus, Ei village, SCI, ...).\n\nThe Congress is composed of a number of tracks (joint-conferences,\ntutorials, sessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions); all will\nbe held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 22-25, 2013. All\ntutorials are free to registered conference attendees - for a partial list\nof approved tutorials, see:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/tutorials \nFor the complete list of joint conferences, see below.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\nApril 6, 2013:     Submission of full/regular papers (about 7 pages)\nApril 27, 2013:    Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)*\nMay 14, 2013:      Final papers + Copyright + Registration\nJuly 22-25, 2013:  The 2013 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer\n                   Engineering, and Applied Computing\n                   (including all its affiliated joint-conferences).\n\n*Authors who submitted their papers early (between January 19th through\n March 19th), will receive their papers' status report (notification)\n by April 18, 2013.\n\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of March 14, 2013, papers published in the conference proceedings that\nare currently being held as part of WORLDCOMP, have received 27,591\ncitations (includes 3,342 self-citations). Citation data obtained from\nhttp://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by April 6, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or pdf\nformats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -\nsingle space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats\nare acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to\nfollow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author. The first page should also identify the name of\nthe Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best\nrepresent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the\npaper is being submitted for consideration must also be stated on the\nfirst page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length\nof the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7\n(two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed\nto be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications\nwill not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The\nInstitute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for\nScientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,\nDatastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);\nand others. Though, there is no guarantee that the proceedings will also\nbe included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings; in the past, the\nproceedings were included in these databases. Therefore, we will also be\nsending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI Compendex/\nElsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for\ndistribution on site at the conference.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity\nto submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration\nin these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each\nof these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,\nEi village, SCI, ...).\n\nSUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:\n\nPoster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except\nfor the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author\nshould state that \"This paper is being submitted as a poster\". Poster\npapers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the\naccepted paper wishes to do so.\n\n\nLIST OF CONFERENCES (alphabetical order based on conference acronym)\n\no BIOCOMP'13:\n  The 14th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Computational\n  Biology\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/biocomp13\n\no CDES'13:\n  The 13th International Conference on Computer Design\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/cdes13\n\no CGVR'13:\n  The 17th International Conference on Computer Graphics & Virtual\n  Reality\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/cgvr13\n\no CSC'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Scientific Computing\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/csc13\n\no DMIN'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Data Mining\n  http://www.dmin-2013.com/\n\no EEE'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on e-Learning, e-Business,\n  Enterprise Information Systems, and e-Government\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/eee13\n\no ERSA'13:\n  The 13th International Conference on Engineering of Reconfigurable\n  Systems and Algorithms\n  http://ersaconf.org/ersa-news/\n\no ESA'13:\n  The 11th International Conference on Embedded Systems and\n  Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/esa13\n\no FCS'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Foundations of Computer Science\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/fcs13\n\no FECS'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer\n  Science and Computer Engineering\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/fecs13\n\no GCA'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Grid & Cloud Computing and\n  Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/gca13\n\no GEM'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Genetic & Evolutionary Methods\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/gem13\n\no ICAI'13:\n  The 15th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icai13\n\no ICOMP'13:\n  The 14th International Conference on Internet Computing and Big Data\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icomp13\n\no ICWN'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Wireless Networks\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icwn13\n\no IKE'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Information & Knowledge Engineering\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/ike13\n\no IPCV'13:\n  The 17th International Conference on Image Processing, Computer Vision,\n  & Pattern Recognition\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/ipcv13\n\no MSV'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and\n  Visualization Methods\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/msv13\n\no PDPTA'13:\n  The 19th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed\n  Processing Techniques and Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/pdpta13\n\no SAM'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Security and Management\n  http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam13/\n\no SERP'13:\n  The 11th International Conference on Software Engineering Research\n  and Practice\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/serp13\n\no SWWS'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Semantic Web and Web Services\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/swws13\n\nJuly 22-25, 2013, Las Vegas, USA.\n\nAll conferences listed above will be held simultaneously;

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
