However, from their very beginning cities have also served as a home to a variety of animals from the domesticated pets and livestock that formed an integral part of many households to the feral and wild animals who have found the urban environment with its novel structures, infrastructures, activities and food stuffs to be rife with opportunities that could be harnessed to their needs.\n>  \n> Although cities are utilitarian creations, they invite and celebrate play.  On the one hand, play can be seen in the colours and contours of the city as its architects and residents play with form and matter to give the streets and structures their shape, identity and meaning.  On the other, play can be seen in the various playful behaviours exhibited by the denizens of the city from the odd pedestrian humming and skipping along the street through the audacious practitioner of parkour jumping from one building to the next to the multitude of games played in and around the parks and playgrounds that dot the city.  Thus, the utilitarian yet playful nature of the city goes hand in hand with the purposeful and playful nature of its inhabitants who go about their days seeking to fulfil both their physical needs and their playful nature and offers a host of opportunities for the evolution of new behaviours and sustainable co-habitation.\n>  \n> Recent advances in microelectronics and the connectivity offered by the internet have led to the development of \u201csmart cities\u201d in which arrays of sensors and actuators are used to monitor and control urban infrastructure with a higher level of efficiency and \u201cplayable cities\u201d in which these devices are employed in the creation of novel interactions and playful experiences within the city.  These advances and the notions of the smart and the playable city offer the means through which we can explore new opportunities for human and animal habitation and co-existence within the city as well as raise new challenges and concerns about privacy, control, distraction and duplicity.\n>  \n> In this workshop we seek to delve into what it means to be a non-human animal in the city and how digital technology and the notions of play can play a part in supporting, enhancing and advancing non-human animal life in the city. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit idea, concept, speculative, work in progress or position papers related to theoretical, methodological, technological or practical aspects of these questions with the aim of furthering the discussion and setting the stage for future collaboration.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n>  \n> \u2022  Critical perspectives on non-human animals and/in the city, be they companions, strays, pests or wild encroachers\n> \u2022 Supporting service animals such as guide dogs in the city\n> \u2022 \u201csmart\u201d cities and \u201csmart\u201d animals \u2013 sensor-based interactions with animals in the city\n> \u2022 The smart and playful city as a digital playground for human and non-human animals\n> \u2022 The Internet of Animals in the smart city\n> \u2022 Policing the polis \u2013 tracking and controlling animals in the city and their access to and through it.  \n>  \n> Papers which may be up to 10 pages long (excluding references) in the CHI Extended Abstract formatshould be submitted as a PDF file via easychair by 27th September 2019. \n>  \n> All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process and therefore and all identifying information about authors needs to  be removed from the submitted manuscripts.  Papers will be selected based on their quality and relevance to the workshop.  Accepted submissions will be published as part of the conference proceedings.  At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the ACI 2019 conference.\n>  \n> Organizers\n>  \n> Yoram Chisik\n> Yoram Chisik is a digital media researcher, information technology catalyst and thinker of errant thoughts.
