Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following\n      on the first page of your submission \"SAM: LATE BREAKING PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"SAM: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\n   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"SAM: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for\npaper categories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttps://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=sam13 .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 2, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed\nto be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications\nwill not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier\nindexing products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,\nwww.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,\nwww.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for\nEngineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,\nCNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,\nEBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final\nEdition of the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the\nconference (the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship\nthe printed proceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the\nconference proceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a\nnumber of sections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number\nof authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity\nto submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration\nin these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each\nof these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,\nEi village, SCI, ...).\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nSAM is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results.\nIt is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of\nother research conferences; namely, The 2013 World Congress in Computer\nScience, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is\nthe largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science,\ncomputer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have 2,100\nor more attendees from over 85 countries.\n\nThe 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote\nlectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and\nposter presentations.

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS:\n\nPartial list of tutorials:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/tutorials\n\nPartial list of keynotes:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/keynotes\n\nLocation of the conference:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/location\n\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of March 14, 2013, papers published in the congress proceedings that\nSAM is part of, have received 27,591 citations (includes 3,342\nself-citations).
