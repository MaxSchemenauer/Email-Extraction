Citation data obtained from\nhttp://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .\n\nSUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by April 20, 2013 and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables,\nand references - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable\ntypesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted\npapers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to\nprepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been\npreviously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The\nfirst page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a\nmaximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content\nof the paper. The name of the conference (ie, SERP) must also be\nstated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word\nabstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)\nwill be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed\nto be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications\nwill not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The\nInstitute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for\nScientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,\nDatastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);\nand others. The proceedings/books of the congress that SERP is part of have\nbeen evaluated for inclusion into major science citation index databases.\nWe are happy to report that so far, the evaluation board of science citation\nindex databases have APPROVED the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of\nthe following conference tracks into relevant Elsevier indexing databases\n(Elsevier indexing databases include, among others: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com;\nSCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com;\nand others): BIOCOMP, DMIN, ERSA, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA,\nand SAM.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with\nElsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)\nand another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science\nand Computational Intelligence).

To\nget a feeling about the Congress's atmosphere, see the 2012 delegates\nphotos available at: http://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of the Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
