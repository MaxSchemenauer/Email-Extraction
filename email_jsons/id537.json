In addition, we also plan to have representatives of\nvarious Venture Capitalists as well as speakers discussing Intellectual\nProperty issues.\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:\n\nIn response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to\nsubmit their papers for evaluation in one of the following three paper\ncategories:\n\n   1. LATE BREAKING PAPERS: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the\n      following on the first page of your submission \"name of conference:\n      LATE BREAKING PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-\n      Ready paper will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and\n      the author will be given the opportunity to present the paper in a\n      formal session.\n\n   2. POSITION PAPERS: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 5. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"name of conference: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be\n      limited to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be\n      given the opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   3. ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPERS: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission \"name of\n      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\". If accepted, The length of the\n      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE\n      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to\n      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either\nMS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable\n(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a\nparticular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication; these formatting instructions appear at:\nhttp://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style\nformat). Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that\nwould best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also\nidentify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with\nhis/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should\nappear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF\nETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on\nthe submission web site.)\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in\nscience citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each\npublished paper. All proceedings are also approved for inclusion into\nEBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The\ntitles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes\nbibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books. We\nanticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these\nbook series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com ; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org ; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com ; and others). For a recent\nand a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that\nhave been published based on the extended versions of many of our\ncongress papers, see the link below:\n\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals \n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement,\nwill have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the\nFinal Edition of the conference proceedings which will go to press\nsoon after the conference (the conference would then make the necessary\narrangements to ship the printed proceedings/books to such authors).\nThe Final Edition of the conference proceedings will be identical to\nearlier edition except for a number of sections/chapters appended to\nthe proceedings/book.\n\n\nINVITATION:\n\nThis announcement is ONLY for those who MISSED the opportunity to submit\ntheir papers in response to earlier \"Call For Papers\". Therefore,\nauthors who have ALREADY submitted papers in response to earlier \"Call\nFor Papers\" should IGNORE this announcement. (Those who have been\nnotified that their papers have been accepted, should still follow the\ninstructions that were emailed to them; including meeting the deadlines\nmentioned in the notifications that were sent to them).\n\nYou are invited to submit a \"LATE BREAKING PAPER\", \"POSITION PAPER\", or\n\"ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\" for consideration. All accepted papers will be\npublished in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN) and will also\nbe made available online. In addition, like prior years, extended\nversions of selected papers (about 35%) of the conference will appear\nin journals and edited research books (publishers include: Springer,\nElsevier, BMC, and others); some of these books and journal special\nissues have already received the top 25% downloads in their respective\nfields. See the link below for a very small subset of the books published\nmostly based on extended versions of the accepted papers of this congress:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/publications . The\ntitles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into\nthe ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes\nbibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.\n\nThe Congress is composed of a number of tracks (federated/joint\nconferences, tutorials, sessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions);\nall will be held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 27-30,\n2015.
