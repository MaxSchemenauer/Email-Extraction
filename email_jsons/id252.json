We are happy to report that\nso far, the evaluation board of science citation index databases have\nAPPROVED the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the following\nconference tracks into relevant Elsevier indexing databases (Elsevier\nindexing databases include, among others: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com;\nSCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com;\nand others): BIOCOMP, DMIN, ERSA, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA,\nand SAM; please see below for the full name of each of these conferences.\nIn addition, all proceedings will be indexed by a number of other science\ncitation databases that track citation frequency/data for each paper.\n\n\nINVITATION:\nYou are invited to submit a full paper for consideration. All accepted\npapers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN)\nand will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed\nin science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for\neach paper. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers\n(about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers\ninclude: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).

Citation data obtained from\nhttp://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them\nto the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must\nbe uploaded by April 20, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or pdf\nformats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -\nsingle space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats\nare acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to\nfollow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for\npublication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently\nsubmitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should\ninclude: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email\naddress for each author.

Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except\nfor the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author\nshould state that \"This paper is being submitted as a poster\". Poster\npapers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the\naccepted paper wishes to do so.\n\n\nLIST OF CONFERENCES (alphabetical order based on conference acronym)\n\no BIOCOMP'13:\n  The 14th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Computational\n  Biology\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/biocomp13\n\no CDES'13:\n  The 13th International Conference on Computer Design\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/cdes13\n\no CGVR'13:\n  The 17th International Conference on Computer Graphics & Virtual\n  Reality\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/cgvr13\n\no CSC'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Scientific Computing\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/csc13\n\no EEE'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on e-Learning, e-Business,\n  Enterprise Information Systems, and e-Government\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/eee13\n\no ERSA'13:\n  The 13th International Conference on Engineering of Reconfigurable\n  Systems and Algorithms\n  http://ersaconf.org/ersa-news/\n\no ESA'13:\n  The 11th International Conference on Embedded Systems and\n  Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/esa13\n\no FCS'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Foundations of Computer Science\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/fcs13\n\no FECS'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer\n  Science and Computer Engineering\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/fecs13\n\no GCA'13:\n  The 9th International Conference on Grid & Cloud Computing and\n  Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/gca13\n\no GEM'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Genetic & Evolutionary Methods\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/gem13\n\no ICAI'13:\n  The 15th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icai13\n\no ICOMP'13:\n  The 14th International Conference on Internet Computing and Big Data\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icomp13\n\no ICWN'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Wireless Networks\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/icwn13\n\no IKE'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Information & Knowledge Engineering\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/ike13\n\no IPCV'13:\n  The 17th International Conference on Image Processing, Computer Vision,\n  & Pattern Recognition\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/ipcv13\n\no MSV'13:\n  The 10th International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and\n  Visualization Methods\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/msv13\n\no PDPTA'13:\n  The 19th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed\n  Processing Techniques and Applications\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/pdpta13\n\no SAM'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Security and Management\n  http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam13/\n\no SERP'13:\n  The 11th International Conference on Software Engineering Research\n  and Practice\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/serp13\n\no SWWS'13:\n  The 12th International Conference on Semantic Web and Web Services\n  http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/conferences/swws13\n\nJuly 22-25, 2013, Las Vegas, USA.\n\nAll conferences listed above will be held simultaneously; ie, same location\nand dates.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nThe Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote\nlectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and\nposter presentations.

To\nget a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2012\ndelegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The\nCongress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary\nresearch initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for\ncross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: sc@world-comp.org\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
