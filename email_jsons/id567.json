This year, the exhibition will be held in connection with the ICIDS conference in Snowbird Ski & Summer Resort, Little Cottonwood Canyon in the Magpie Gallery. The art exhibition will be held in conjunction with the academic conference, which runs from 19  23 of November, with the opening taking place on November 20th at 6 pm (MST). A printed catalog of descriptions of the work and artists statements with supporting images will be given to exhibitors and conference attendees at the opening of the exhibition.\n\nThe ICIDS 2019 Art Exhibition offers the opportunity for artists to present artworks relevant to the field of interactive storytelling through the broad lens of the curated theme: The Expression of Emotion in Humans and Technology.

Students will discuss the work with experts in the area and with peers in a friendly atmosphere where discussion and contributions will be encouraged. Students should have defined their research plan, and can be in intermediate or advanced stages of their research. Regardless of how far along the students are in their research, the work should still be in-progress and malleable enough to take advantage of the feedback from the Doctoral Consortium.\n\nMore information about the doctoral consortium and submission guidelines can be found here: https://icids.eae.utah.edu/doctoral-consortium/ \nImportant Dates\nAugust 1, 2019                      Submission deadline\nAugust 27, 2019                    Notification of acceptance\nSeptember 13, 2019\t\tCamera-ready copy due\nNovember 19 - 23, 2019\tDoctoral consortium celebration (throughout the conference)\n\nChair\nBen Samuel (University of New Orleans, US)\n\nFor general questions, please email the ICIDS Program Chairs by using the following email address: icids2019program@gmail.com \nWe look forward to seeing your contributions at ICIDS 2019!\n Rogelio\n[On behalf of myself and my co-chair, Anne Sullivan (Georgia Institute of Technology, USA)]\n\n--\n\n\tRogelio E.
