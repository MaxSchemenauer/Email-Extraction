Therefore, authors who have\nalready submitted papers in response to earlier \"Call For Papers\" should\nIGNORE this announcement. (Those who have been notified that their papers have\nbeen accepted, MUST still follow the instructions that were emailed to them;\nincluding meeting the deadlines mentioned in the notifications that were sent\nto them).\n\nYou are invited to submit a \"Late Breaking Paper\", \"Position Paper\", or\n\"Abstract/Poster Paper\" for consideration. All accepted papers will be published\nin printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN) and will also be made available\nonline. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers (about 45%) will\nappear in journals and edited research books (publishers include: Springer,\nElsevier, BMC, and others). In addition to the above, we have arranged two new\nbook series (multiple books in each series); one with Elsevier publishers\n(Emerging Trends in Computer Science and Applied Computing) and another with\nSpringer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the whole process takes 12 months), a\nsignificant number of authors of accepted papers of ABDA, will be given the\nopportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication\nconsideration in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a\nyear in each of these book series projects. Each book in each series will be\nsubject to Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org;\nEMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others).\n\nABDA'14 is composed of a number of tracks, including: tutorials, sessions,\nworkshops, posters, and panel discussions.

Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in\n      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following\n      on the first page of your submission \"ABDA: LATE BREAKING PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.\n\n   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the\n      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,\n      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward\n      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.\n      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the\n      first page of your submission \"ABDA: POSITION PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\n   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD\n      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please\n      write the following on the first page of your submission\n      \"ABDA: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER\".\n      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited\n      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the\n      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper\ncategories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:\nhttp://world-comp.org .\nSubmissions must be uploaded by June 5, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or\npdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the\nauthors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting\nformat to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have\nbeen previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first\npage should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5\ntopical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for originality,\nsignificance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of contradictory\nrecommendations, a member of the conference program committee would be\ncharged to make the final decision (accept/reject); often, this would involve\nseeking help from additional referees. Papers whose authors include a member\nof the conference program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded\nreview process. (Papers deemed to be philosophical, essay type, or about\ncontroversial topics/applications will not be refereed but may be considered\nfor discussion/panels/presentation).\n\nThe ABDA'14 proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN)\nand will also be made available online. The proceedings will be sent for\ninclusion into science citation databases that track citation frequency/data\nfor each published paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET /\nThe Institute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for\nScientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,\nDatastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);\nand others.\n\nNote that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will\nhave their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition\nof the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference\n(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed\nproceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference\nproceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of\nsections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\nJune 5, 2014:       Submission of papers for evaluation (the sooner, a submission\n                    is received, the earlier, the notification will be sent out.)\nJune 14, 2014:      The notification of acceptance will be sent out typically one\n                    week after the paper has been submitted.\nJune 26, 2014:      Registration\nJuly 21-24, 2014:   The 2014 International Conference on Advances in Big Data\n                    Analytics (ABDA'14)\nAugust 20, 2014:    Camera-Ready Papers Due for publication\n                    (Papers submitted and accepted in response to this announcement\n                    will be published in the Final Edition of the proceedings which\n                    will go to press soon after the conference; they will also be\n                    indexed in science citation index databases.)\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\n\nABDA is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,\nprofessionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster\nworking relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is\nbeing held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research\nconferences; namely, The 2014 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer\nEngineering, and Applied Computing.

To get a feeling about the\nconferences' atmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:\nhttp://infinitydempsey.smugmug.com/WorldComp\nhttp://worldcomp.phanfare.com/\n\nAn important mission of The Congress is \"Providing a unique platform for\na diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,\ndevelopers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted\neffort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities\n(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,\nand research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also\nattempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as\ntheir main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that\nhave research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to\nachieve its institution and geography diversity objectives.\"\n\nOne main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated\nresearch conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated\nresearch meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model\nfacilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer\nscience, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also\nencourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;\nie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across\nsub-disciplines.\n\nTUTORIALS:\n\nAll tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials\nthat have been approved so far can be found at:\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp14/ws/tutorials\nWe plan to offer more tutorials (in addition to what is already posted on\nthe web).
