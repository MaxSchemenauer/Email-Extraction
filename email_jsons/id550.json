Although effective, the complexity of these models can often make the results difficult to understand, explain, evaluate, and scrutinize. There is therefore a significant demand from governments, businesses, and the wider society for interpretable, explainable and accountable decision-making models and systems.   \n    \nInteractive visual analytics offer great potential in this space by marrying human intelligence with machine power, through visual representations of data and interaction techniques, to aid humans in better generating, interpreting, evaluating, and deploying statistical and machine learning models. In this special issue, we will feature cutting-edge research where interactive visual analytics methods are applied together with complex computational methods for making explainable and accountable decisions informed by data.   \n       \nScope, Description, and More Information     \n      \nThis special issue invites submissions that feature original research on designing, developing and evaluating interactive visual analytics methods that empower their users to make explainable and accountable inferences and decisions based on massive amounts of data. A suitable submission must also demonstrate its relevance to TiiS, the premier journal featuring interactive intelligent systems with two distinct characteristics: intelligence and interactivity. In particular, a suitable submission must exhibit or discuss how the resulting approaches, techniques, or systems advance an interactive intelligent system. Interdisciplinary and applied research is especially encouraged.     \n     \nSpecific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:     \n     \n  * Role of interactive visualization in interpretable and explainable machine learning   \n  * Human factors in making decisions with machine learning models   \n  * Facilitating algorithmic transparency and accountability through visual analytics   \n  * Interactive visualization for supporting non-experts in creating and interpreting complex analysis results   \n  * Visual analytics for interactive, informed machine-learning model building   \n  * Uncertainty-aware visual analytics for the consideration of inherent uncertainty in data and models   \n  * Interactive visual analytics for addressing biases in the data and machine learning models    \n   \nSchedule     \n     \n  * Full paper submission deadline: November 17, 2019   \n  * First author notification: Feb 14, 2020   \n  * Revised paper due: April 20, 2020   \n  * Final author notification: May 15, 2020    \n  * Expected publication: Summer 2020   \n       \nCheck out http://tiis.acm.org/authors.cfm for author information and submission details.    \nFor further information, please contact cagatay.turkay@city.ac.uk.   \n     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n    \nTo stop receiving emails about publishing in ACM journals, unsubscribe at:          \nhttps://optout.acm.org/unsubscribe.cfm?re=foaad@calpoly.edu&rl=CFP    \n     \nAssociation for Computing Machinery              \n1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, USA               \nCopyright 2019, ACM, Inc.    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n    <title>Call for Papers</title>\n    <meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"noindex, noarchive, nofollow\">\n\n\n  </head>\n  \n  <body style=\"font-family: verdana, tahoma, geneva, arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.2; color: #333333; text-align:center\"><!--[if gte mso 15]><table border='0' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='100%' align='left'><tr><td><![endif]-->\n  \n  <table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"670\">\n  \t\n    \t<tbody><tr><td>\n        \n        \t<table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"670\">\n            \t<tbody><tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n                \t<td colspan=\"2\" height=\"10\"></td>\n                </tr>\n\n\t\t\t\t<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n                \t<!-- main body -->   \n\t\t\t\t\t<td width=\"650\" style=\"padding: 10px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- header --><img src=\"http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/gallery/acm/plone-images/acm_logo1.gif\" width=\"280\" height=\"72\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" alt=\"\"></a><br>\n<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 14px; font-weight: lighter; color: #000000;\">CALL FOR PAPERS<br>  </div>   <br>\n<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;\">ACM Transactions on <br>Interactive Intelligent Systems<br>\n\t<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000;\"><em>Special issue on Interactive Visual Analytics for <br>Making Explainable and Accountable Decisions</em><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;\">Guest Editors</div>\n\n\t\t<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000; line-height: 1.5em;\">Dr. Cagatay Turkay, City, University of London, UK<br>\nProf. Tatiana von Landesberger, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany<br>\nDr. Remco Chang, Tufts University, USA<br>\nDr. Shixia Liu, Tsinghua University, China<br>\nDr. Daniel Archambault, Swansea University, Wales\n<br>\n</div><br>\n\n<!-- end of header --><hr><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/gallery/membership/bulletin_images/tiis_rgb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"146\" height=\"\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" border=\"\" align=\"right\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n<!--<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000;\"><strong>Information For Contributors</strong></div> -->\n<div style=\"font-family: verdana, arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000; line-height: 1.3em; vertical-align:top;\">\n<!-- story -->\n\t<b>Background</b><br><br>\n\nDue to recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, complex and advanced machine learning models have been developed and used increasingly in making data-driven decisions that have significant impact on science, business, and the wider society.
