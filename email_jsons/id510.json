That's NOT what scholarship is supposed to be\n        about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatrin Becker, PhD\n\n\n(sent from gmail)\n\n\nPresident, \nMink Hollow Media\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, \nMount Royal University\n\n        (Calgary, AB, Canada)\n\n\nAuthor:\n\n\n \n Choosing and Using\n          Digital Games in the Classroom  A Practical Guide\n,\n        Springer, 2016\n\n\nand \n\n\n \n The\n          Guide to Computer Simulations and Games\n, Wiley, 2011\n\n\nOwner \nMink Hollow Farm\n\n\n\n\n\n          E-mail: \nbecker@minkhollow.ca\n\n            HomePage: \nhttp://minkhollow.ca/becker\n\n          Blog: \nhttp://beckerblog.ca\n\n          Books: \nhttp://books.minkhollow.ca\n\n          Amazon: \nhttp://amazon.com/author/kbecker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have found the missing link between the\n            higher ape and civilized man - it is we. - Konrad Lorenz\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/7/2019 1:23 PM, Carl Therrien\n      wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Michael,\n        \n\n\n\n\nI'm just trying to think of solutions that would make\n          participants feel safe to submit. People on location know best\n          if they could be held accountable for the presentations made\n          by participants outside the country. It might seem a bit\n          paranoid to think the government would go to the extent of\n          intercepting and listening if it is not presented as LGBT\n          related, but in such a context it would not be surprising that\n          authorities pay close attention to any event in academia and\n          be very proactive about holding people accountable. I trust\n          orgnizers know best about this.\n\n\n\n          Again, no easy solutions. It is hard to balance the benefits\n          for the local communities of having these conferences be\n          hosted in parts of the world with violent regimes and the need\n          to be as inclusive as possible for every instalment of the\n          conference.\n\n\n\n          Best,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Therrien\n\n\nProfesseur agrg\n\n                              Universit de Montral\n\n\nTlphone:\n                                      514 343 6111 poste 3677\n\n\nBureau:\n                                      C-2138\n\n\n\n\nDpartement\n                                d'histoire de l'art et d'tudes\n                                cinmatographiques\n\n\n\n\nC.P.\n                                  6128, succursale Centre-ville\n\n\nMontral\n                                  (Qubec) CANADA\n\n\nH3C\n                                  3J7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nGamesnetwork, discussion list of Digital Games Research Association, \nwww.digra.org\n\nNote: to unsubscribe, send \"UNSUBSCRIBE GAMESNETWORK\" to \nLISTSERV@UTA.FI\n from\nyour subscribed email account.
