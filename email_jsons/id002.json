The IEEE WCCI 2016 will host three conferences: The 2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2016), the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2016), and the 2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC 2016) under one roof. It encourages cross-fertilization of ideas among the three big areas and provides a forum for intellectuals from all over the world to discuss and present their research findings on computational intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE WCCI 2016 will be held at the Vancouver Convention Centre, Vancouver, Canada. Vancouver is Canada's Pacific gem, offering a winning combination of world-class hotels, meeting venues, and restaurants in a setting of spectacular beauty. Few convention cities can offer such a wide range of cosmopolitan amenities in a downtown core that is safe, clean, pedestrian friendly, and stunning in its backdrop of mountains and ocean.</p>\n\n<p>IJCNN is a flagship conference of the International Neural Network Society and the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. It covers a wide range of topics in the field of neural networks, from biological neural network modeling to artificial neural computation. FUZZ-IEEE is a premier conference in the field of fuzzy systems. It covers all topics in fuzzy systems, from theory to applications. IEEE CEC is a premier event in the field of evolutionary computation, and covers all topics in evolutionary computation from theory to applications. Papers for IEEE WCCI 2016 should be submitted electronically through the congress website, and will be refereed by experts in the fields and ranked based on the criteria of originality, significance, quality and clarity.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has maintained its position as a leader of journals in computational intelligence. According to the 2013 Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports (JCR), CIS journals sustained their status as premier scholarly publications, earning high rankings in the Impact Factor report.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (IF: 4.370)</li>\n  <li>IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (IF: 6.306)</li>\n  <li>IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (IF: 5.545)</li>\n  <li>IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games (IF: 1.167)</li>\n  <li>IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development (IF: 1.348)</li>\n  <li>IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine (IF: 2.706)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n-----------------------------~*******~-----------------------------<br>\n<strong>Special Sessions, Tutorials, Competitions &amp; Workshops</strong><br>\n-----------------------------~*******~-----------------------------<br>\n\n<strong>Special Sessions:</strong>  <p>Special session proposals are invited to the 2016 IEEE WCCI. Special session proposals should include the title, aim and scope (including a list of main topics), and the names of the organizers of the special session, together with a short biography of all organizers. A list of potential contributors will be very helpful. All special sessions proposals should be submitted to the Special Sessions Chairs.</p>\n\n<strong>Tutorials:</strong>  <p>The IEEE WCCI 2016 solicits proposals for tutorials aimed at researchers, students and practicing professionals. Tutorials offer a unique opportunity to disseminate in-depth information on specific topics in computational intelligence. If you are interested in proposing a tutorial, would like to recommend someone who might be interested, or have questions about tutorials, please contact one of the Tutorials Co-Chairs most appropriate to your topic (and copy your email to other Tutorials Co-Chairs).</p>\n\n<strong>Competitions:</strong>  <p>Prospective competition organizers are invited to submit their proposals to the Competitions Chair. A common website for all accepted competitions will be provided on the congress website, for which a link to the homepage of each competition maintained by their organizers independently will be provided.</p>\n\n<strong>Workshops:</strong>  <p>The IEEE WCCI 2016 invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the main event. The overall purpose of a workshop is to provide participants with the opportunity to present and discuss novel research ideas on active and emerging topics of Computational Intelligence. Topics of the proposed workshops should therefore be aligned with those set forth in the call for papers for the main event. Prospective workshop organizers are invited to submit their proposals to the Workshops Chair.</p>\n\n\n-------~****~-------<br>\n<strong>Important Dates</strong><br>\n-------~****~-------<br>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Special Session &amp; Workshop Proposals Deadline:  15 November 2015</li>\n  <li>Competition &amp; Tutorial Proposals Deadline:  15 December 2015</li>\n  <li>Paper Submission Deadline:  15 January 2016</li>\n  <li>Paper Acceptance Notification Date:  15 March 2016</li>\n  <li>Final Paper Submission &amp; Early Registration Deadline:  15 April 2016</li>\n  <li>IEEE WCCI 2016:  25-29 July 2016</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>For more information on the congress, please visit: www.wcci2016.org<br><br>\n\n2016 IEEE WCCI General Co-Chairs,<br>\n\nKay Chen Tan, Gary G.
