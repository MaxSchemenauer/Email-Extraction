All reasonable\ntypesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted\npapers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to\nprepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been\npreviously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\nThe first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,\naffiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The\nfirst page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a\nmaximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content\nof the paper. The track title must also be stated on the first page of\nthe paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length of the\nfinal/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7 (two-column\nIEEE style) pages.\n\nEach paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for\noriginality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of\ncontradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program\ncommittee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);\noften, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers\nwhose authors include a member of the conference program committee will\nbe evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical\npapers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and\nwill also be made available online. The printed proceedings/books will\nbe available for distribution on site at the conference. The proceedings\nwill be indexed in science citation databases that track citation\nfrequency/data. The proceedings/books of SAM annual conferences have\nbeen evaluated and approved for inclusion into major science citation\nindex databases for indexing, integrating, and inclusion into relevant\nsystems. The proceedings have also been approved for inclusion into\nEBSCO (www.ebsco.com), one of the largest subject index systems. The\ntitles of proceedings of SAM have been indexed into the ACM Digital\nLibrary ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes bibliographic citations\nfrom major publishers in computing.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple\nbooks in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in\nComputer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer\npublishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational\nIntelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18\nmonths), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our\ncongress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version\nof their papers for publication consideration in these books. We\nanticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these\nbook series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to\nElsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:\nScopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,\nwww.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others). For a recent and\na very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that have\nbeen published based on the extended versions of our congress papers,\nsee below:\n\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals \n\n\nSUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:\n\nPoster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same\ninstructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except\nfor poster submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author\nshould state that \"This paper is being submitted as a poster\". Poster\npapers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the\naccepted paper wishes to do so. Please email your poster papers to the\nposter co-chairs:\nHanen Idoudi ( Hanen.Idoudi@ensi.rnu.tn ), or\nEsmiralda Moradian ( esmirald@dsv.su.se ).\n\n\nPROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS/SESSIONS:\n\nEach conference is composed of a number of tracks. A track can be a session,\na workshop, or a symposium. A session will have at least 6 papers; a\nworkshop at least 12 papers; and a symposium at least 18 papers. Track\nchairs will be responsible for all aspects of their tracks, including:\nsoliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ... The names of track chairs\nwill appear as Associate Editors in the conference proceedings and on the\ncover of the printed books (and indexed in science databases as such).\n\nProposals to organize tracks (sessions, workshops, or symposiums) should\ninclude the following information: name and address (+ email) of proposer,\nhis/her biography, title of track, a 100-word description of the topic of\nthe track, and a short description on how the track will be advertised\n(in most cases, track proposers solicit papers from colleagues and\nresearchers whose work is known to the track proposer). E-mail your track\nproposal to the Workshops/Sessions co-chairs:\nFlaminia Luccio ( luccio@unive.it ) or Shadi Banitaan ( banitash@udmercy.edu ).\nWe would like to receive the track proposals as soon as possible. 138939\n\n\nMEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:\n\nAs of December 14, 2014, proceedings of the federated congress that this\nconference is part of, have received over 27,914 citations (includes 3,346\nself-citations). Citation data is obtained from Microsoft Academic Search.\nThe citation data does not even include more than 15,000 other citations\nto papers published by conferences whose first offerings were initiated\nby the congress. Individual proceedings/books (2013 & 2014) of the\nfederated congress can be purchased from major science book distributors:\n(such as: EBSCO and others):\nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp14/ws/proceedings \nhttp://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/proceedings \n\nCONTACT:\n\nInquiries should be sent to: daimikj@udmercy.edu\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis email was sent to:  foaad@calpoly.edu \n\nTo opt out of this email list: \nhttp://world-comp.org/cgi-bin/rm/full.cgi?08696a75-4b61-49a8-bc69-dce167aa057d \n\n",
