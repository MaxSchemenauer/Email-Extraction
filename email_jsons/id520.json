It might be the best option available for providing safe presentation options to queer and particularly trans game studies scholars if the conference is to continue in St. Petersburg, but it\u2019s not an ideal or particularly inclusive solution. I don\u2019t have an easy answer to this because there isn\u2019t one, but it seems to me that the conference has to decide between safety and support for LGBTQ game scholars and the importance of holding the conference in different locations that allow more people to participate. Whatever is decided here and moving forward, I think it\u2019s important that the safety of queer folks not be sacrificed in the name of holding a conference in more locations, and ideally finding conference locations that accomplish both. I do hope that the St. Petersburg conference will provide opportunities to present for folks who aren\u2019t able to make other international conferences and particularly local LGBTQ folks, though it seems that they too might have to be careful about what they present at the conference.\n> \n> I would also humbly submit that if you\u2019re working on a trans or queer game as a cisgendered and/or straight scholar and think that the queerness of that game is coincidental or not the main point, that you may need to think carefully about your positionality in relationship to that game, how you are using it, and to what ends.
